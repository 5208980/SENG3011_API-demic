# Note: There can be two types of logs for your API- You can return a json snippet
# with your API response to the end user, which includes the details such as team
# name, accessed time, data source. Also you can keep a log file in back-end that
# contain details such as which API end point was accessed at what time, how long
# it took to address the request, resource utilization etc. that are useful for
# API monitoring and performance improvement.
