Excerpt and then several ill-tempered comments:\nThe total number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases reached 70, local health officials announced on Thursday at a news conference.\u00a0\nThe virus, which only had confirmed cases in King and Snohomish counties, had a newly confirmed case in Grant County. As of 11 a.m., Wednesday, the count included 51 cases and 10 deaths in King County, 18 cases and one death in Snohomish County, and one case in Grant County.\u00a0\nWashington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler announced at the news conference an emergency order that would require state health insurers to waive copays and deductibles for people who require coronavirus testing. The order also included allowing \"a one-time early refill for prescription drugs,\" Kreidler said.\u00a0\nAt the news conference, Gov. Jay Inslee along with health officials such as the state's health officer Dr. Kathy Lofy, repeated that those with mild symptoms still don't need to be tested.\u00a0\n\"If you have mild symptoms, whether it's a positive or negative result, you're still going to get the same treatment advice,\" Inslee said. \u00a0\nThe Washington State Department of Health on its website said \"people with flu-like symptoms are not being tested for COVID-19 unless they meet certain criteria set by the CDC,\" which allows new tests to be used for high-risk people.\u00a0\nKing County health officials announced on Wednesday 10 newly confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the total throughout the county up to 31 as of 1:15 p.m. Wednesday.\u00a0\nThe 10 cases included one death, which means now nine people have died due to COVID-19 in King County, or 10 deaths statewide. The person whose death was announced Wednesday was a resident of Life Care, a nursing and rehabilitation facility in Kirkland. She was a woman in her 90s, hospitalized at Evergreen Health and died on Tuesday. \u00a0\nNine of the 10 new cases announced Wednesday were linked to Life Care. Of those eight, seven were residents. The other two were \"associated\" with the facility according to a news release from King County Public Health. A tally of the 31 cases in King County showed 22 of them were linked with Life Care.\u00a0\nAt a news conference Wednesday, King County Executive Dow Constantine laid out new recommendations, not mandates, from the county on how to handle the outbreak of the virus. He also announced all non essential government meetings were to be canceled for the next three weeks, with a check-in on the virus situation at the end of each week.\u00a0\nThose who are 60 and older, with underlying health conditions -- which includes heart and lung disease or diabetes -- with weakened immune systems and people who are pregnant should stay home as much as possible, King County Public Health Director Patty Hayes said at the news conference.\u00a0\nThose who feel sick or believe they have been exposed should take steps like isolating themselves, contacting their doctors and watching their health, officials said.\u00a0\nConstantine said employers should encourage people to telecommute.\nObliging insurers to waive co-pays and deductibles for people needing COVID-19 tests is in itself a damning confession of a failed healthcare system. The DR Congo suspends fees for all healthcare payments in Ebola-hit regions; do American health insurers have to be put in a half-nelson to keep them from shaking down suspected COVID-19 cases?\nIt sounds as if some of Kirkland Life Center's staff have caught COVID-19. And if people who think they've been exposed isolate themselves at home, what happens to the Life Center's residents?\nIt's also hard to telecommute to a job that involves changing adults' diapers.\u00a0\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-postcard-from-the-front-lines-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-rome-as/", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 02:53", "headline": "Postcard from the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak: Rome as ghost town", "main_text": "\nVia The Globe and Mail, a report by the paper's\u00a0 European bureau chief, Eric Reguly:\u00a0Postcard from the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak: Rome as ghost town. Excerpt:\nI had a delightful walk through Rome\u2019s historic centre on Thursday morning, delightful because I had some of the world\u2019s most exquisite sites \u2013 Piazza Navona, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain \u2013 pretty much to myself. No, the weather wasn\u2019t miserable; it was warm and sunny. The coronavirus was keeping the tourists away. \u00a0\nFor the first time in my dozen years in Rome, I could hear the water from Piazza Navona\u2019s baroque fountains the moment I entered the square. Normally, the long oval expanse, which traces the shape of the ancient Stadium of Domitian and is now dominated by a Gian Lorenzo Bernini masterpiece, the Fountain of the Four Rivers, is a mass of babbling humanity, stuffed with jugglers, musicians, cheesy artists, several thousand tourists with selfie-sticks and caf\u00e9 patrons paying extortionate prices for cappuccino and gelato. \u00a0\nThe surreal experience was bliss for me; I had not been to Piazza Navona for a year because I always found the eternal crowds wearisome, an assault on the spot\u2019s artistry and elegance. In the era of Airbnb and discount airlines, there is no such thing anymore as off-season in Caput Mundi.\u00a0\nRepeat at the Spanish Steps, which, too, were pleasingly empty. I treated myself to a caffe macchiato at Caffe Greco, the Roman landmark that opened in 1760 and whose patrons have included Casanova, Goethe and Keats, who died nearby, in an apartment overlooking the Spanish Steps, from another infectious disease \u2013 tuberculosis. There were two of us in the entire place and my coffee was served in 30 seconds flat. I asked the barman whether he was enjoying the respite from the jostling crowds. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit bored.\u201d\u00a0\nBetter bored than broke, for the novel coronavirus, and the resulting COVID-19 disease, is rattling the nerves of Italians and bringing on financial distress. The tourists began to disappear about two weeks ago, about the time 11 towns in the north of Italy, all of them hit hard by the virus, were quarantined. On Wednesday, the government closed all the schools in Italy, sending parents scrambling for babysitters, until March 15, though not a single parent I talked to believes they will reopen by that date. The virus is spreading by the minute and won\u2019t disappear magically on March 14. \u00a0\nAt last count, more than 3,800 Italians were ill with the virus, some of them severely so, and 148 had died. A common question among Italians: what if hospital admissions surge and there are not enough ventilators to treat the critical patients?\u00a0\nThe workers who depend on tourism for a living are becoming frightfully worried.\u00a0\nTypically, half a dozen horse-drawn carriages wait for tourists at the base of the Spanish Steps, near Pietro Bernini\u2019s lovely Fountain of the Boat (talented family; Pietro was the father of Gian Lorenzo). The coachmen, known as vetturini, are often the sons and grandsons of coachmen, passing their licences through the generations. The work can be lucrative. A 45-minute tour of Rome\u2019s wonders can set you back \u20ac150, the equivalent of about $225. Repeat even two or three times a day and the cash builds up.\u00a0\nCoachman Augusto Celli, 45, was slumped in the back seat of his black carriage when I talked to him, his horse Strike standing as still as a statue in the sun. \u201cI am getting only one or two tours a week,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe coronavirus is spreading too much alarm among the tourists and we\u2019re suffering. My wife doesn\u2019t work, I have two kids. Now we\u2019re eating a lot of pasta \u2013 pasta doesn\u2019t cost much.\u201d\nIn Piazza Navona, the waiters and waitresses were standing in front of their caf\u00e9s like carnival barkers, waving menus and urging the few tourists who strolled by to take a seat. Tucci, a restaurant and caf\u00e9 in the shadow of the Fountain of the Four Rivers, has 100 small tables outside. Precisely one of them was occupied, by a couple from Edinburgh. The chattier of the two, Alison Essom, who works for an insurance company, said she loved Rome\u2019s crowd-free status.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a calculated risk being here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re used to travelling where things aren\u2019t perfect. In Asia, we have to get rabies jabs.\u201d\u00a0\nEven though Romans are nervous about the potentially devastating effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, they are adapting and keeping their sense of humour. Gone are handshakes and cheek kisses, on government orders. The \u201cWuhan handshake\u201d has replaced them, an amusing little stunt that involves tapping elbows or shoes. My Canadian-Roman friend, Jeannie Marshall, said, \u201cThe Italians are not kissing! I can\u2019t think of a more ominous sign of the apocalypse.\u201d\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/business/stock-market-covid-19.html?emc=edit_na_20200305&ref=cta&nl=breaking-news&campaign_id=60&instance_id=0&segment_id=21910&user_id=ae826ce801a36328c316f398b051b0ad&regi_id=33579017", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 02:19", "headline": "Stocks plunge again on coronavirus fears", "main_text": "\nAfter a day when the Dow fell 969 points, The New York Times reports:\u00a0Stocks Plunge Again on Coronavirus Fears. Excerpt:\nMarkets nose-dived as virus outbreaks multiplied\nThe stock market has swung wildly in the past week as investors have struggled to get a bead on the economic damage the fast spreading coronavirus might cause, as the number of cases continues to rise and companies step up measures to contain them.\u00a0\nThat jarring volatility continued on Thursday, with the S&P 500 falling more than 3 percent. The index has now climbed or fallen more than 3 percent on six different days in the past two weeks, something that had not happened even once in the prior 12 months. \u00a0\nShares of airlines plunged and industrial, financial and energy stocks also fell sharply. Worry about long-term growth also pushed the yield on 10-year United States Treasury notes to a new low. Because of their relative safety, government bonds are in high demand during bouts of panic over the economy.\u00a0\nAfter markets closed on Thursday, Starbucks warned that its quarterly sales in China, where it has a huge presence, would fall 50 percent compared to last year, resulting in a $400 million to $430 million hit to its revenue forecast.\nNews about the coronavirus\u2019s spread has been relentless: A cruise ship being held off the coast of San Francisco has suspected links to two coronavirus cases, one of them fatal. The governor of California declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, and 18 states have infected patients. \u00a0\nAround the world, more than 90,000 cases and 3,000 deaths have been reported.\u00a0\nThe jump in the number of cases in the United States has crystallized expectations that the crisis will last longer than earlier predictions suggested. And without the kind of full-court-press efforts that China staged to guard against the virus\u2019s spread, some analysts worried that infections could expand widely.\u00a0\nEconomists at the Institute of International Finance slashed their outlook for the global economy on Thursday, downgrading their 2020 forecast for the growth in the United States to 1.3 percent that in China to below 4 percent. The revisions could \u201cconceivably\u201d take global growth to 1 percent, the weakest since 2009, said the chief economist, Robin Brooks, and down from 2.6 percent last year. \u00a0\n\u201cThe concern is that almost nothing has been done to stop the spread of the virus in the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth.\u00a0\nPolicymakers have responded by cutting interest rates to prop up economic growth. They are expected to do so again, but the sell-off reflects in part the fact that lower interest rates will not address the immediate impact of the virus if factories are closed, workers are furloughed and consumers stop spending.\n\u201cWith the daily infection rate escalating it is doubtful that rate cuts will be particularly effective in limiting the immediate downdrafts on economic activity,\u201d Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura, warned in a research note on Thursday \u2014 two days after the Federal Reserve announced an emergency interest rate cut.\nAlso on Thursday, the International Air Transport Association substantially expanded its forecast for the financial damage that could result from travel bans and customers\u2019 reluctance to fly, saying that $63 billion to $113 billion in annual global airline revenue could be wiped out. \u00a0\nUnited Airlines and American Airlines both fell more than than 13 percent, while Delta fell about 7 percent.\u00a0\nOil producers are looking for a large cut to production as demand softens.\u00a0\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries proposed Thursday that oil output be curbed by 1.5 million barrels a day to deal with the effects of the spreading coronavirus outbreak on demand.\u00a0\nThe proposed cuts are more than most analysts expected but seem unlikely to change the gloomy sentiment in the oil market. After the announcement, prices for Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell about 0.8 percent to $50.71 a barrel.\u00a0\nThe impact on airlines is \u2018almost without precedent.\u2019\u00a0\nThe coronavirus could wipe out $63 billion to $113 billion in annual global airline revenue this year, the International Air Transport Association said Thursday. \u00a0\nAs carriers around the world halt flights and tourism sputters in the face of spreading outbreaks, the financial impact on the airline industry will be \u201calmost without precedent,\u201d said Alexandre de Juniac, the president of the association.\u00a0\nThe low-end $63 billion figure is more than double the estimate that I.A.T.A. put out just two weeks ago. Since the outbreak began, industry share prices have fallen almost 25 percent, or about five times more than during the 2003 SARS crisis, according to the group.\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bd6d69e2025d9b393278200c-pi", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 11:50", "headline": "University Canada West closes Vancouver campus following presumptive case of COVID-19", "main_text": "\n\nThanks to my Tyee colleague David Beers for sending the link to this Globalnews.ca report:\u00a0University Canada West closes Vancouver campus following presumptive case of COVID-19.

Excerpt and then a comment:\nHere\u2019s the latest news on the outbreak. \u00a0\n5 March 15:30 GMT \u2014 China study suggests children are as likely to be infected as adults \u00a0\nChildren are just as likely to get infected with the new coronavirus as adults, finds one of the most detailed studies yet published on the spread of the virus, known as SARS-CoV-2. The analysis \u2014 based on data from Shenzhen, China \u2014 provides a partial answer to one of the most pressing questions surrounding the outbreak: the role of children. \u00a0\nPrevious studies have suggested that kids were far less likely to develop severe symptoms when infected by the coronavirus, compared with other age groups. But it was not clear if it was because they weren\u2019t getting infected or if they were fighting off the infection more effectively than others. \u00a0\n\u201cKids are just as likely to get infected and they\u2019re not getting sick,\u201d says Justin Lessler, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. He co-led the study with Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Qifang Bi, and epidemiologists Ting Ma, at the Harbin Institute of Technology in Shenzhen, and Tiejian Feng, of the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. They posted the analysis to the medRxiv preprint server on 4 March. \u00a0\nThe study is unique in that it looked at not only people who were infected with the virus, but also large numbers of their close contacts, some of whom were infected and many who were not. The researchers followed 391 people who were diagnosed based on their symptoms, and 1,286 of their close contacts to see whether they tested positive for the virus even if they didn\u2019t show symptoms. Overall, the team found that children under 10 who were potentially exposed to the virus were just as likely to become infected as other age groups, with about 7 and 8% of contacts of known cases later testing positive.\u00a0\nThey also found that people who lived in the same household as an someone infected with the virus \u2014 and came into close contact with them \u2014 were about six time mores likely get infected, compared with people who made contact with an infected person in other settings.\u00a0\n\u201cThis may be the first clear evidence that children are as susceptible as adults to SARS-CoV-2 infection,\u201d says Ben Cowling, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. He now wonders whether the fact that outbreaks haven\u2019t been observed in schools could be down to the fact that children\u2019s symptoms are mild.\u00a0\nLessler says it\u2019s still not clear whether children are important in transmitting the virus, as they are with influenza, where children routinely develop symptoms and are common hubs in chains of transmission. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the current critical remaining questions and we\u2019re trying to figure out how to answer,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a 7-month-old and a 6-year-old and I can\u2019t imagine that, if they have any virus at all, they're not getting it on somebody.\u201d\nThis reminds me of the days when I used to teach students in my college's early childhood education program. The students spent their days in daycares and their evenings in class, and they often came in with terrible colds\u2014a well-understood occupational hazard of the profession. The idea of toddlers and other children as efficient COVID-19 spreaders is not a reassuring one.\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/media-communication/press-release/detail/-/asset_publisher/default/content/coronavirus-sono-3-296-i-positivi", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 11:22", "headline": "Italy: 3,858 COVID-19 cases", "main_text": "\nVia Civil Protection, the Thursday update:\u00a0Coronavirus: 3.296 positive cases.

Excerpt:\nTwo weeks ago, I sent an e-mail from Rome, where I had been enjoying a sabbatical semester of research and writing, to a Chinese friend who lives in one of those small cities of five or six million inhabitants, very far from Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic. In my note, I said that I was sure that she was safely distant from the current crisis, but that, all the same, I was thinking of her and beaming her my warmest wishes.\u00a0\nShe replied politely that she was happy that I was having such a lovely sabbatical. As for her, however, though she was in good health, her life and the lives of everyone around her were turned topsy-turvy. The streets in her city were empty; places of work were all closed; she and her family were confined at home; one of them per day might receive permission to go out, masked, to shop for food and supplies; everyone lived in fear. I was suitably embarrassed by my e-mail\u2019s ridiculous insouciance, but at the time I did not fully grasp the extent of my stupidity.\u00a0\nI get it now, thanks to the unfolding events in Italy. The initial reports of an outbreak, in a few towns in the north of the country, were alarming enough, but it remained news coming from far away. With astonishing rapidity, the situation worsened: in quick succession, whole communities were quarantined; schools and churches closed their doors; museums, galleries, and palaces were shuttered; concerts were cancelled.\u00a0\nIf anyone hadn\u2019t already taken in the gravity of the situation, two further occurrences made it overwhelmingly apparent: parts of Milan Fashion Week, the crown jewel of one of Italy\u2019s greatest economic successes, were closed to the public, and, still more ominously, the soccer game between Inter Milan and a rival was played before an eerily empty stadium. As any Italian knows, soccer, far more than religion, is sacred; denying fans access to the match was an even more drastic signal than temporarily closing Milan Cathedral to tourists and the faithful.\u00a0\nIn Rome, the virus had not yet surfaced, and there were very few signs of alarm, apart from a run on hand sanitizer. But, as the constant reports in the newspapers and on television accumulated, the mood altered. The news from the north, we began to say to one another, resembled the thud of artillery shells exploding in a battle somewhere across the mountains, out of sight but no longer so far distant as to be inaudible.\u00a0\nAnd then steadily the enemy moved across Lombardy and Veneto and south into Tuscany and Umbria. Where were our defenders? If we were to continue the military metaphor, we had to concede that Venice was gravely threatened, then Bergamo, then Florence. Rome would fall soon.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut, as our conversations about the virus continued\u2014and it was increasingly impossible to talk about anything else\u2014the image of an approaching army gave way to other attempts to understand what was happening. Of course, even in the popular press, there was no end of epidemiological articles, often quite serious and detailed ones written by experts, along with the familiar lists of advice: wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face, clean all surfaces, keep washing your hands, move away from people who are coughing, avoid crowds, try to stay at least one metre away from everyone else.\u00a0\nBut, however informative all of this is\u2014and we consumed a vast amount of it in only a few days\u2014in situations of stress, it is, as usual, literature that offers the most powerful ways of grasping what is happening or may come to pass, not in the precise biological sense but in its narrative unfolding. So our conversations turned to Saramago\u2019s \u201cBlindness,\u201d Camus\u2019s \u201cThe Plague,\u201d Defoe\u2019s \u201cA Journal of the Plague Year,\u201d Manzoni\u2019s \u201cThe Betrothed,\u201d and, above all\u2014the greatest of these fictional depictions\u2014the opening chapter of Boccaccio\u2019s \u201cDecameron.\u201d\u00a0\nThe problem is that, as brilliant as these accounts are, they depict cultures in the grip of epidemic disease as collapsing into chaos, violence, and the rupturing of social bonds. But this is not at all what we were reading about in the newspapers or experiencing for ourselves. In China, if the accounts are accurate, there is something like the opposite: an extraordinary intensification of social order, figured in the software with which the government tracks many citizens\u2019 health and movement. In Italy, there has been no comparable intensification\u2014quite apart from the technology, such control is quite alien to the national character\u2014but instead the marked presence of the warmth and kindness that make ordinary life here so agreeable, notwithstanding the country\u2019s notorious political dysfunction.\u00a0\nIt is as if people instinctively sense, even as their anxiety levels rise and their economy sinks, that their version of social order rests on good humor, patience, inventiveness, and flexibility. The mother and son who run the fruit and vegetable stand at the outdoor market, the local genius who concocts wildly implausible flavors of gelato, the clerk at the nearby gym who somehow remembered (or pretended to remember) that I had a temporary membership four years ago and waived the initiation fee\u2014all seem, under the pressure of the crisis, somehow to hold onto their innate sweetness.\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 07:52", "headline": "Nursing homes are starkly vulnerable to COVID-19", "main_text": "\nVia The New York Times:\u00a0Nursing Homes Are Starkly Vulnerable to Coronavirus.

The outbreak, leaving seven dead and eight others ill through Wednesday morning, exposed the great vulnerability of the nation\u2019s nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and the 2.5 million Americans who live in them. \u00a0\nThese institutions have been under increasing scrutiny in recent years for a unique role they play in inflaming epidemics. Research shows these homes can be poorly staffed and plagued by lax infection-control practices, and that residents frequently cycle to and from hospitals, bringing germs back and forth.\u00a0\nNow, public health experts fear these facilities could become central to the rise and spread of the novel coronavirus. Statistics from China show that the infection caused by the virus, called Covid-19, kills nearly 15 percent of people over 80 years old who have it and 8 percent of people in their 70s \u2014 the very population that makes up more than half the population of these homes.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have to prepare for the inevitability that there are going to be facilities like the one in Washington where you\u2019re going to have the virus and have it move rapidly through nursing homes and assisted living facilities,\u201d said Dr. David Dosa, a geriatrician and professor of medicine at Brown University, where he studies disaster preparedness.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlready, 380,000 people die annually from infections at these long-term care facilities, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, and 1 million people get serious infections in them.\u00a0\nIndustry critics \u2014 who have become more vocal in recent years \u2014 say that many facilities are alarmingly unprepared for coronavirus and that the government\u2019s guidance so far has been short on detail and urgency. \u00a0\n\u201cNursing homes are incubators of epidemics,\u201d said Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York who heads the nonprofit Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.\u00a0\n\u201cEvery facility should be holding a boot camp to train health care workers,\u201d she said.

Doctors said his death was due to Covid-19, respiratory tract obstruction, and respiratory failure.\u00a0When he was declared recovered, he met the official diagnostic standard of recovery and he had tested negative for the virus twice. But CT scans of his lungs still showed symptoms of viral pneumonia. An expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention who spoke to Caixin on condition of anonymity said he left the hospital too early.\u00a0\u201cHow can he be allowed to leave the hospital just two days after CT scans still showed typical coronavirus pneumonia symptoms?\u201d he said.\u00a0\r\nBut it is unclear whether he died after recurrence of the disease. A radiologist in a Wuhan hospital told Caixin that loose application of the diagnostic standard may be to blame for his death.\r\n\u00a0Recovered patients in several regions across China have tested positive for the virus after recovering, but it remains unknown whether such patients could infect others.

The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, which first announced the case last week, also stressed that there is still no evidence to show pets can transmit the virus, adding that owners need not worry too much and should certainly not consider abandoning their animals.\u00a0\r\nThe dog was tested several times, and results repeatedly showed traces of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, the department said in a statement issued late Wednesday. The dog was first tested on Feb. 26, yielding low-level positives from nose and mouth swabs, the department said. Similar tests on Feb. 28 and March 2 found the same results.\u00a0A department official told Caixin the dog in question was a Pomeranian and was taken into the department\u2019s care on Feb. 26 with none of the Covid-19 symptoms experienced by humans, such as cough, runny nose or difficulty breathing.\r\n\u00a0\u201cExperts from the School of Public Health of The University of Hong Kong, the College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong and the World Organisation for Animal Health have been consulted, and unanimously agreed that these results suggest that the dog has a low-level of infection and it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission,\u201d the department said in a statement.\r\n\u00a0It added it will continue testing the dog and only return it to its owner when the results are negative. An official from the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection previously told Caixin that the dog\u2019s 60-year-old owner was diagnosed with the virus on Feb. 25. She started coughing on Feb. 12, was hospitalized on Feb. 24, and is now in stable condition. Her brother and sister-in-law also tested positive, though neither showed any symptoms.\u00a0\r\nThe multiple weak positives showed the dog had been infected, and perhaps could serve as a potential intermediate host for cross-species transmission of the new coronavirus, Zhu Huachen, associate director of the Joint Institute of Virology at Hong Kong University told Caixin. She said the dog\u2019s lack of symptoms showed the virus could live inside it, allowing the animal to secrete and spread the virus at the same time.\u00a0\r\nOther experts disagree. The 2003 outbreak of SARS also saw a small number of animals show low levels of that virus, but none became sick and none could spread the virus to humans, Vanessa Barrs, Chair Professor of Companion Animal Health and Disease at City University\u2019s Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences said on Wednesday.\r\n\u00a0Others pointed out that it\u2019s far too early to jump to any conclusions, and that it\u2019s not clear whether the viral material found in the dog was viable.\r\n\r\n\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/reports/244/2020-february-week-6", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 07:24", "headline": "Nigeria: National case management guidelines for COVID-19", "main_text": "\nVia the NCDC:\u00a0National case management guidelines for COVID-19.

In the last one month, NCDC has conducted further assessments in existing infectious disease treatment centres. This assessment has focused on identifying gaps and developing plans to rapidly ensure that we are prepared to manage all cases of COVID-19, regardless of the severity. \u00a0\nFrom the 17th \u2013 19th of February, 2020, the Coronavirus Preparedness Group successfully conducted a workshop to develop protocols and guidelines for case management of COVID-19. These guidelines will be used by health care workers in providing care for patients, in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. \u00a0\nThe workshop which was supported by Resolve to Save Lives, had subject matter experts drawn from relevant specialised fields. This includes physicians, clinical virologists & nurses with MDR-TB management experience from teaching hospitals, WHO and other partners working closely with the National COVID-19 Preparedness Group.\u00a0\nAn important outcome from the workshop was the development of an interim national case management guideline for COVID-19 highlighting:\u00a0\n1.

The original seropositive sample and additional urine and blood samples tested negative for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses by RT-PCR, and a repeat dengue rapid test (SD Bioline) was also negative. Thus, the initial dengue seroconversion result was deemed a false positive.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second case is a 57-year-old woman with no relevant past medical, travel, or contact history, who presented to a regional hospital on Feb 13, 2020, with fever, myalgia, a mild cough of 4 days, and 2 days of diarrhoea. She had thrombocytopenia (92\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL) and tested positive for dengue IgM (SD Bioline). She was discharged with outpatient follow up for dengue fever.

Chest radiography was normal and she was admitted for dengue fever. She remained febrile despite normalisation of her blood counts and developed dyspnoea 3 days after admission. She was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab. A repeat dengue test (SD Bioline) was negative and an earlier blood sample also tested negative for dengue by RT-PCR.

Excerpt:\nIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).\u00a0\nThanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented. Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learning is largely undisrupted.\u00a0\nAlthough these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health. Evidence suggests that when children are out of school (eg, weekends and summer holidays), they are physically less active, have much longer screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less favourable diets, resulting in weight gain and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness. Such negative effects on health are likely to be much worse when children are confined to their homes without outdoor activities and interaction with same aged friends during the outbreak.\u00a0\nPerhaps a more important but easily neglected issue is the psychological impact on children and adolescents. Stressors such as prolonged duration, fears of infection, frustration and boredom, inadequate information, lack of in-person contact with classmates, friends, and teachers, lack of personal space at home, and family financial loss can have even more problematic and enduring effects on children and adolescents.\u00a0\nFor example, Sprang and Silman showed that the mean posttraumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined than in those who were not quarantined. Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle changes and psychosocial stress caused by home confinement could further aggravate the detrimental effects on child physical and mental health, which could cause a vicious circle.\u00a0\nTo mitigate the consequences of home confinement, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the community, school, and parents need to be aware of the downside of the situation and do more to effectively address these issues immediately. Experiences learned from previous outbreaks can be valuable for designing a new programme to tackle these issues in China.\u00a0\nThe Chinese Government needs to raise the awareness of potential physical and mental health impacts of home confinement during this unusual period. The government should also provide guidelines and principles in effective online learning and ensure that the contents of the courses meet the educational requirements.\u00a0\nYet it is also important not to overburden the students. The government might mobilise existing resources, perhaps involving NGOs, and create a platform for gathering the best online education courses about healthy lifestyle and psychosocial support programmes available for schools to choose from. For example, in addition to innovative courses for a better learning experience, promotional videos can be useful to motivate children to have a healthy lifestyle at home by increasing physical activities, having a balanced diet, regular sleep pattern, and good personal hygiene.\u00a0\nTo make these educational materials truly effective, they must be age-appropriate and attractive. They require professional expertise and real resources to create.\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30521-3/fulltext", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 06:49", "headline": "Has China faced only a herald wave of SARS-CoV-2?", "main_text": "\nVia The Lancet:\u00a0Has China faced only a herald wave of SARS-CoV-2?\nThe attack rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calculated by mathematical models, from estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2\u20133, suggests that 50\u201360% of the population should eventually be infected because the population seems to be entirely naive to the new virus. The observed attack rate on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained slightly below 20% (705 of 3711 passengers and crew members became infected).\u00a0\nIt is of utmost importance to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China is subsiding, as local authorities and the entire international community might wish. With 80\u2008026 COVID-19 cases officially reported from China as of March 2, 2020, the proportion of the population affected remains far from 50%, or even 20%, of China's 1\u00b74 billion people. Has China just experienced a herald wave, to use terminology borrowed from those who study tsunamis, and is the big wave still to come?\u00a0\nSerosurveys can help answer these questions precisely. To serosurvey the outbreak would involve testing sera of blood samples from the most representative sample of the population at the epicentre of the epidemic, Wuhan. Serology analysis with neutralising antibodies from the 1000 people could allow for the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections to be estimated with good accuracy. This rate could be extrapolated to the city's entire population and thus inform more precisely whether the provisional attack rate during this period was a few cases per thousand or perhaps affected 1\u20132% of the population, 20%, or more. Serosurveys should be seen as polls before elections; they can be repeated several times, week after week, to monitor the epidemic precisely.\u00a0\nThere is no reason to wait for the end of the epidemic before doing serosurveys. The results would be tremendously informative to China, first and foremost, and to the entire international community, on the risk of big secondary epidemic waves.\n", "reports": []}, {"url": "https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/b-c-announces-13th-case-of-coronavirus-woman-in-critical-condition-1.4839293", "date_of_publication": "2020-3-05 06:43", "headline": "Canada: BC announces 13th case of COVID-19", "main_text": "\nVia CTV News:\u00a0B.C. announces 13th case of coronavirus; woman in critical condition. Excerpt:\nVICTORIA -- Health officials in British Columbia announced the province's 13th case of coronavirus Wednesday. \u00a0\nA woman in her 80s in the Vancouver area recently returned from travelling in Hong Kong and India before her tests showed a presumptive positive for the potentially deadly virus.\u00a0\nB.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said the woman is in critical condition at Vancouver General Hospital.\nProvincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the woman was part of a tour group in India and officials are looking at who else was on the trip and whether they may have also been exposed.\u00a0\nHenry said other Canadians were on the trip and have returned to regions outside B.C. where health officials will contact them for monitoring. \u00a0\n\"She's had quite a severe illness and she is currently in critical condition in isolation in the ICU,\" said Henry. \u00a0\n\"In British Columbia, the risk still remains very low,\" she said, but added the situation is changing \"day by day.\"\u00a0\nThe latest case of COVID-19 in B.C. brings Canada's total number of infections to 34. \u00a0\nDix said Tuesday that the province is testing more vigorously for the new coronavirus than just about any other jurisdiction, which has resulted in greater containment.\u00a0\nProvincial officials announced four new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, including three people who recently returned from Iran.\u00a0\nThe fourth was a woman in her 30s who developed symptoms while in isolation because of her contact with another confirmed case linked to Iran.\n", "reports": []}]}
