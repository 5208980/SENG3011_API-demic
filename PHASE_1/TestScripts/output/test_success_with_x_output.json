            "main_text": "\nVia The Washington Post:\u00a0Coronavirus latest: China tries to close off Wuhan, city at the center of outbreak. Excerpt:\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese health authorities sought to impose a quasi-quarantine Tuesday around Wuhan, advising people in the city of 11 million people not to leave, as they stepped up efforts to stop the spread of a mystery virus that has claimed six lives. \u00a0\nWith confirmation that the pneumonialike coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, and with hundreds of millions of Chinese packing onto public transport to make their annual pilgrimages home for the Lunar New Year, a new sense of panic has erupted here. \u00a0\nLong lines formed at pharmacies and convenience stores around the country as people rushed to buy surgical masks, with unlucky customers posting photos on social media of bare shelves. People around the country canceled their trips home for the Spring Festival, as new year celebrations are known, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really dare to go to the airport right now, or even to the movie theater,\u201d said Xie Jing, 33, who works in advertising in Shanghai, where there have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus. She canceled her planned trip home to Sichuan, where two cases are suspected.\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone is being very careful at the moment in Shanghai. Everyone is wearing masks on the streets,\u201d Xie said. \u00a0\nThe Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would call an emergency meeting Wednesday to decide whether to designate the outbreak as an international public health emergency. Australia and the Philippines are the latest countries with suspected cases of the infection, and Taiwan also confirmed one person there had caught it.\nThe virus was first detected on Dec. 31 and was linked to a dirty food market in Wuhan, not far from one of the city\u2019s main train stations, where wild animals including wolf pups and civet cats had been on sale for consumption.\nThe number of people in China confirmed to have the virus topped 300 on Tuesday, according to the National Health Commission, an increase of more than 70 from Monday. The vast majority of cases are in Wuhan, where Mayor Zhou Xianwang said six people have now died from the virus. \u00a0\nWuhan\u2019s three major hospitals have 800 beds, but authorities said they would add 1,200 beds to deal with the rising number of pneumonia cases. They also said they would foot the hospital bills for those infected.\nInitially, doctors thought that the virus was not communicable between humans, but cases of infection across the country, including among people who have not been to Wuhan, proved that it can be passed on.\u00a0\nSome 60 people across 15 provinces are being monitored for possible infection, with cases found as far afield as Dalian in the northeast and Chongqing in the southwest, as well as in the metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.\u00a0\u00a0\nSpecialists are urging travelers not to move in and out of the central Chinese city.\u00a0\n\u201cWe hope people can avoid going to Wuhan if possible and that people in Wuhan can stay there,\u201d said Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the leader of a government team of experts responding to the outbreak. \u201cThis is not a call from the officials but a suggestion from us in the expert team,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nStill, he said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the virus would continue to spread as people moved around the country for the turning of the Lunar New Year on Saturday. \u00a0\nThe Ministry of Transport estimates that 400 million people will be on the move, making a total of 3 billion trips during this period.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Globe and Mail:\u00a0Weeks before lockdown, Wuhan authorities used 'refrigerating strategy\u2019 to downplay coronavirus. Excerpt:\nAs Chinese authorities widened a massive urban lockdown and flew large numbers of medical personnel to Wuhan, the epicentre of a new SARS-like virus, medical authorities provided new indications that weeks of inaction had allowed the virus to spread widely before serious measures were taken.\u00a0\nChinese authorities initially reported that the new 2019-nCoV coronavirus had most seriously affected the elderly and those left vulnerable by pre-existing health conditions. \u00a0\nBut an academic study published by Chinese researchers in The Lancet on Friday found that of the first 41 confirmed cases of the virus, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, \u201cless than half had underlying diseases.\u201d Nearly half were 49 years of age or younger. And a third had not been exposed to the wild animal market identified as the source of virus, suggesting that even from the earliest days, it had begun to leap between people.\u00a0\u00a0\nFifteen per cent of those first 41 people died. \u00a0\n\u201cWe are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission,\u201d warned the paper\u2019s authors, who included dozens of doctors from hospitals in Wuhan and major state institutes for infectious disease research.\u00a0\nThe first of the patients was admitted to hospital on Dec. 16, more than a month before Chinese authorities began to lock down Wuhan and neighbouring cities in Hubei province. \u00a0\nBy Saturday evening, nearly all of Hubei, with a population of 58 million, was under some form of lockdown, with authorities halting most forms of transportation and barring entry and exit to at least 15 cities. China has counted 1,369 confirmed cases and 41 deaths. New cases have also been confirmed in Malaysia, Australia, Nepal, France, Singapore and the U.S.\u00a0\nThe growing reach of the virus comes after weeks of inaction in Wuhan, where it is believed to have originated at a market selling wild animals. Though China has been credited for an unusual degree of transparency in the past week, virologists have faulted the country for acting too slowly in the early days of its spread, allowing infected people to travel widely inside and outside Wuhan. \u00a0\nNow, new evidence is emerging that officials in Wuhan deliberately downplayed the virus, even after formally notifying the World Health Organization on Dec. 31 about what the WHO described as \u201ca cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.\u201d \u00a0\nBut the Wuhan government took a \u201crefrigerating strategy\u201d in the early days of the viral spread, a doctor at Wuhan Union Hospital told China News Weekly. Medical staff were banned from speaking publicly about what was taking place or accepting media interviews, the doctor said.\u00a0\nPolice in Wuhan also said in early January that they had arrested eight people for spreading \u201crumours\u201d about what was then a little-understood pneumonia affecting a growing number of people.\u00a0\nAnother person claiming to be a Wuhan physician wrote to the National Health Commission this week claiming that doctors in the city were told not to report \u201cviral pneumonia\u201d in their imaging reports between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16 \u2014 a period during which local officials delivered sunny reports on a local situation under control. That meant that, during a crucial period in which cases were accumulating, local health-care workers were unable to properly raise the alarm, the person wrote. The Globe and Mail was unable to independently verify the report, which was widely circulated in China and not refuted by state media.\u00a0\nA doctor at Wuhan\u2019s Hubei Xinhua hospital has now died from the virus, state media reported Saturday morning. The death of Liang Wudong, 62, comes amid widespread reports of a large number of unreported cases of medical staff infected by the virus, and accusations that an improper dissemination of information kept those treating the ill from taking proper precautions themselves.\n",

Excerpt:\nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called an emergency government meeting, telling officials the country is facing a \u201cgrave situation\u201d as the new coronavirus is \u201caccelerating its spread\u201d. \u00a0\nMore than 50 million people are spending China\u2019s most important holiday under lockdown as the country expands its travel restrictions in an attempt to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.\u00a0\nOfficials confirmed on Saturday, the lunar new year, that the death toll from the viral outbreak had reached 41 and more than 1,200 other people had been affected. \u00a0\nA doctor treating people infected with the virus was among those who died. Liang Wudong, 62, died on Saturday morning, state media said, and it was also reported by the Chinese Global Times website that another doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan died of a heart attack later in the day. \u00a0\nIn Beijing, five new cases have been confirmed, according to Chinese National Radio, including two patients who had not recently travelled to Hubei, the centre of the outbreak. In all previous cases in the capital, patients had reportedly visited the province.\nThe virus is now confirmed to have reached Australia and Malaysia, while France confirmed on Friday that three people there had the virus. Both France and the US plan to evacuate citizens trapped in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the outbreak began. \u00a0\nHong Kong, which has confirmed five cases of the illness, declared the outbreak an emergency on Saturday, and said it would keep primary and secondary schools closed for two more weeks after the holiday.\nA growing number of airports around the world have introduced screening to identify those affected, although the effectiveness of such measures has been questioned. An article published in the Lancet, based on a family that had recently visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, suggested it was possible to have the disease while not experiencing any symptoms. \u00a0\nAcross China, the lunar new year holiday has been overshadowed by travel blocks imposed on at least 17 cities, and the cancellation of major festive events. In an effort to stop the disease from spreading further, part of the Great Wall was closed, and Beijing\u2019s temple fairs, a new year tradition, have been cancelled. Shanghai Disneyland also announced it would close indefinitely.\u00a0\nIt is feared the lunar new year, when hundreds of millions of people go on holiday or to visit relatives, could fuel the spread of the virus across China and abroad.\u00a0\nSo far, 29 provinces and cities in China have been affected, and further cases had been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The US reported its second case.\n",

She is currently in a government hospital, where she was admitted on January 25, but was no longer showing symptoms. \u00a0\nDOH Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said authorities would check the establishments that she went to and trace employees she had been in contact with.\u00a0\nThe samples from the Chinese woman were among the 6 sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia for testing earlier this week. The 5 others tested negative.\u00a0\nSucceeding tests for 2019-nCoV will now be done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), as the DOH has already acquired the necessary test kit for the procedure, the results of which may be available within 24 hours of testing.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Washington Post:\u00a0Coronavirus latest: Death in the Philippines, more countries restrict China travel. Excerpt:\nBEIJING \u2014 The Philippines has blocked entry to travelers from China, including from Hong Kong and Macao, after a man from Wuhan died in Manila of the coronavirus, the first person outside China to succumb to the pneumonia-like respiratory illness. \u00a0\nWith the coronavirus continuing to spread beyond China\u2019s borders, more countries are moving to close their doors to foreign nationals who have visited there. New Zealand, Iraq and Indonesia joined the Philippines on Sunday in imposing new restrictions on people coming from or through China.\nThe virus has been detected in small numbers in some 20 other countries \u2014 from the United States and France to Thailand and Australia \u2014 while the number of infections in China has surged to nearly 14,500, according to the latest National Health Commission figures.\u00a0\nThe number of deaths has risen to 304, although anecdotal reports suggest the true number could be much higher.\u00a0\nA 44-year-old Wuhan man died in a Manila hospital Sunday, after arriving, via Hong Kong, on Jan. 21. He was admitted to a hospital with pneumonia four days later and his 38-year-old companion remains hospitalized, but there was no evidence of local transmission, the country\u2019s Department of Health said.\nEven before the man\u2019s death, President Rodrigo Duterte had decided to expand the Philippines\u2019 travel restrictions from those traveling from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, to the rest of mainland China, as well as its special administrative regions, Macao and Hong Kong.\n\u201cI wish to emphasize that we are not singling out Chinese nationals,\u201d Sen. Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go, a close aide to Duterte, said in an interview with DZBB radio station on Sunday, after meeting with the president on Saturday night. \u201cIt covers all travelers from China to the Philippines regardless of nationality.\u201d\nNew Zealand\u2019s government announced that starting Monday, it would deny entry to foreign travelers arriving from China and order returning New Zealanders to isolate themselves for 14 days.\u00a0\nIndonesia said it would immediately bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days, the maximum incubation period, from entering or transiting. Iraq\u2019s Interior Ministry said it would ban all foreign nationals coming from China. \u00a0\nThese three countries have not reported a case of coronavirus on their shores.\u00a0\nThey, however, join countries including the United States, Australia and Singapore in imposing travel restrictions on visitors from China. Japan and South Korea have imposed looser rules on people from the Hubei province, although the subtropical South Korean island of Jeju, where 98 percent of foreign tourists are Chinese, said Sunday that it would rescind visa-free entry for them.\u00a0\u00a0\nSouth Korea on Sunday reported three more cases of infection, taking the total to 15, while India confirmed its second case. The United States now has eight infections. \u00a0\nBut even as countries around the world impose restrictions on travel from China, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s combative spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, has sought to frame the coronavirus outbreak as part of a bigger, existential battle between the United States and China.\u00a0\nAfter U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the coronavirus could \u201chelp\u201d to bring jobs to the United States as companies moved operations away from China, Hua said these \u201cunfriendly U.S. comments\u201d were \u201ccertainly not a gesture of goodwill.\u201d\n\u201cMany countries have offered China support in various means,\u201d she said. \u201cIn sharp contrast, certain U.S. officials\u2019 words and actions are neither factual nor appropriate.\u201d AD\u00a0\nOver the weekend, she singled out the United States for going against the World Health Organization\u2019s advice that travel limitations were not necessary, even though a raft of other countries have also imposed restrictions. \u00a0\nA \u201ccertain country has turned a blind eye to WHO recommendations and imposed sweeping travel restrictions against China,\u201d Hua tweeted Saturday. \u201cThis kind of overreaction could only make things even worse. It\u2019s not the right way to deal with the pandemic.\u201d\n",

Excerpt:\nYOKOHAMA, Japan \u2014 Quarantined for two weeks on a cruise ship ravaged by the novel coronavirus, the Britons on board have only one option: Keep calm and carry on.\u00a0\nDavid Abel and his wife, Sally, are still smiling, for now. Their friends Alan and Wendy Steele are going \"stir crazy\" trapped in their cabin \u2014 although they say they are not worried about catching the deadly illness. Still, this was not how the Steeles planned to spend their honeymoon.\u00a0\nMany of the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on the Diamond Princess are struggling to keep their spirits up, after the luxury liner was quarantined off the Japanese coast Wednesday, with passengers forbidden to leave their cabins.\u00a0\nLast Saturday, a man from Hong Kong who had spent five days aboard the ship was confirmed as having contracted the coronavirus. On Wednesday, with the ship docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan\u2019s Health Ministry said nine other passengers and one Filipino crew member had tested positive.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got two weeks\u2019 extra cruise, albeit a confined cruise,\u201d David Abel, 74, said on a Skype call from his cabin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the best of the situation, haven\u2019t you? But I\u2019m sure that in 10 or 12 days\u2019 time, I\u2019ll be pulling my hair out.\u201d\nThe nine passengers who tested positive \u2014 two Australians, three from Japan, three from Hong Kong, and one American \u2014 have been transferred to hospitals, but none is in serious condition, said Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato. They were among 31 people deemed at high risk who were initially examined for the pneumonia-like virus, while samples from 242 other people are being tested.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor those left on board, there is nothing to do but sit in their cabins, wait for meals to be delivered, watch television or a choose from a limited selection of movies on demand. Those lucky enough to have a balcony can at least sit in the sun, look at the ocean and talk to their neighbors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not getting anything really positive or encouraging talking to them,\u201d Abel quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s all doom and gloom as far as they\u2019re concerned.\u201d\u00a0\nAbel said his greatest sympathy is with those confined to the inside cabins. \u00a0\n\u201cCan you imagine? It would be liked being locked in a wardrobe, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cNo fresh air. No natural light. It really must be a living hell for them.\u201d\u00a0\nOther passengers tweeting from the ship or talking to Japanese media showed the anxiety on board.\u00a0\n\u201cStill shocked and scared. But better precautions. Have faith in the crews and captain,\u201d tweeted Yardley Wong, who describes herself as a Christian entrepreneur from Hong Kong.\n",

Excerpt:\nA cruise operator says 251\u00a0Canadians are aboard a quarantined cruise ship where there's been a confirmed outbreak of coronavirus off the coast of Japan.\u00a0\nPrincess Cruises confirmed the passenger count on the Diamond Princess in an email to CBC News on Tuesday night. None of the Canadian passengers have tested positive for the virus during the first phase of screening, the email says. \u00a0\nSo far, 10 people from the ship\u00a0have tested positive for coronavirus and have been taken ashore to hospital. \u00a0\nJapan took protective measures to prevent the spread of the disease on Tuesday, ordering the quarantine of\u00a0all 3,700 people on the ship for at least 14 days at Yokohama, near Tokyo. Food, provisions\u00a0and other supplies will be brought on board, the cruise line wrote.\u00a0\nPrincess Cruises said the\u00a0affected patients include:\u00a0\n\u2022 2 from Australia.\u00a0\n\u2022 3 from Japan.\u00a0\n\u2022 3 from Hong Kong.\u00a0\n\u2022 1 from the U.S.\u00a0\n\u2022 1 from the Philippines.\u00a0\nThey were among 273 people tested because they had a cough or fever, which are symptoms of the virus, or had close contact with a man who got off the ship in Hong Kong and was infected.\u00a0\nThe path of transmission to each affected person isn't clear, and the others may have gotten the virus when they got off the ship at other port calls in Vietnam, Taiwan, Kagoshima and Okinawa.\u00a0\nHong Kong puts another ship into quarantine\u00a0\nA Hong Kong official says people on board a cruise ship that was turned away from a Taiwanese port will be quarantined until they are checked for the new virus.\nThe World Dream ship, operated by Genting Cruise Lines, was refused entry at Kaohsiung port on Tuesday after three passengers on an earlier voyage were later diagnosed with the new coronavirus.\u00a0\nPort health official Leung Yiu Hong says 90 per cent\u00a0of current passengers are from Hong Kong and no one is from mainland China.\u00a0\nHe says more than 30 crew members with symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat will undergo tests.\u00a0\nLeung said everyone will undergo temperature screening and must fill in a health declaration form. \u00a0\nThey won't be allowed to leave until the tests are done. Leung said the length of the quarantine or the possibility of other steps will depend on the health tests.\n",

Excerpt:\nFears of an epidemic on board a cruise ship off Yokohama came to a head Friday as the health ministry reported 41 more coronavirus infections, bringing the total to 61 so far.\u00a0\nHealth minister Katsunobu Kato said the new cases on board the Diamond Princess emerged from the remaining 171 samples taken from 273 passengers who showed symptoms or who had close contact with symptomatic passengers.\u00a0\nKato said the health ministry is planning to expand the testing to cover seniors and people with pre-existing conditions.\u00a0\nElsewhere, authorities in Taiwan confirmed the same day that a cruise ship off Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, that was not allowed to dock in Japan will be allowed to return to Keelung, near Taipei, according to local media reports.\u00a0\nThe approval came a day after Taiwan\u2019s ban on cruise ships took effect amid the mass outbreak on the Diamond Princess.\nThe 41 infected passengers reported on Friday range in age from their 20s to their 80s. Twenty-one of them are Japanese citizens, he said.\u00a0\nPrincess Cruises, the ship\u2019s operator, said the rest included eight Americans, five Canadians, five Australians, an Argentinian and a Briton. They will be taken to hospitals in Kanagawa, Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Shizuoka prefectures, according to the health ministry.\u00a0\nAuthorities earlier this week had already confirmed that 20 people on the ship had been infected, including one crew member.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the number has increased as a result of people being in a confined space, inside the cruise ship, making repeated contact\u201d over a period of time, Kato said.\u00a0\nAbout 3,700 passengers and crew members were on the Diamond Princess when it was put under a two-week quarantine off Yokohama on Wednesday. They won\u2019t be allowed to disembark until at least Feb. 19, Princess Cruises said. \u00a0\nThe ship came to the attention of medical authorities when it was revealed that a man who left it on Jan. 25 in Hong Kong was infected. Two people who had close contact with him later tested positive for the coronavirus. \u00a0\nThe health ministry and Defense Ministry sent a total of ten doctors and five nurses to the ship to perform checkups and other medical procedures. In addition, up to 80 Self-Defense Forces troops will be dispatched to assist the medical team there, the Defense Ministry said.\u00a0\nIncluding confirmed cases on the ship, the total number of infections in Japan is 86, putting the country second behind China.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The New York Times:\u00a0As Coronavirus Stifles China, Economic Logjams Build Worldwide. Excerpt:\nIn Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine before being able to reload. BHP, which has headquarters in London and Melbourne and is one of the world\u2019s largest copper mining companies, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.\u00a0\nAnd from Qatar to Indonesia, exporters of liquefied natural gas face the prospect of disrupted shipments after a crucial importer in China is reportedly turning back deliveries after invoking clauses in long-term contracts that blame a \u201cgreater force.\u201d \u00a0\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking global commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a rippling out,\u201d said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t see it stopping.\u201d \u00a0\nPrices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquid natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged. Currencies of countries that export these goods at high rates, including Brazil, South Africa and Australia, are near their lowest levels in recent memory. And manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut. \u00a0\nThe woes of the commodities markets \u2014 arguably the worst-performing asset in financial markets this year \u2014 reflect the basic reality that China\u2019s industry-heavy economy is the most important consumer of raw materials on earth.\nAnd drastic efforts to quell the outbreak, including a lockdown of Wuhan, a city of 11 million, and severe curtailment of transportation nationwide, have slowed the Chinese economy sharply. \u00a0\nJPMorgan economists now think China\u2019s economy will grow at a pace of just 1 percent in the first quarter, well down from an initial forecast that anticipated a peppy 6.3 percent rate.\nThe slowdown will be most pronounced in the industrial sector. Most Chinese provinces had extended the Lunar New Year holiday and kept factories closed until Monday in an effort to contain the virus. Some have reopened, but it could be weeks or months before production can fully ramp up.\nThat is a major challenge for the supply chains that have developed in recent decades to deliver a constant supply of the materials that make Chinese factories hum. \u00a0\nCommodities markets have tumbled as those factories idled. Iron ore is down more than 10 percent this year. Copper is down about 8 percent, as is nickel, a key ingredient for stainless steel. Zinc and aluminum are both down more than 5 percent in 2020. \u00a0\n\u201cThere is a big drop in consumption and you need storage space,\u201d said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at the French bank BNP Paribas, in London. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have storage space that\u2019s one of the reasons why the buyers have invoked this clause.\u201d\u00a0\nOne of China\u2019s largest importers of liquefied natural gas, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC, was one of the entities to invoke a \u201cforce majeure\u201d clause, according to multiple news reports. Asian gas prices tumbled in response; benchmark prices for North Asian liquid natural gas are down more than 30 percent in 2020.\n",

Excerpt:\nCoronavirus infections aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess rose to 174 after 39 more people tested positive, the health ministry said Feb. 12.\u00a0The infection also spread to a\u00a0quarantine officer who helped to keep track of the health of crew and passengers.\u00a0\nAn additional four passengers had developed severe symptoms, the ministry said.\u00a0\nTo date,\u00a0492 crew and passengers of the nearly 3,700 people on board have been tested for the coronavirus. The vessel was placed under a minimum two-week quarantine on Feb. 5 and remains berthed at a pier at Yokohama Port.\u00a0\nOf the new cases, 10 were crew members and 29 were passengers, who ranged in age from their teens to their 80s, the ministry said. Ten of the infected passengers were Japanese, while seven were from the United States and four each from China, Australia and the Philippines.\u00a0\nThose who tested positive will be taken to local hospitals for medical treatment. The male quarantine officer who tested positive boarded the ship on Feb. 3 and 4 to collect questionnaires and check for fevers. He followed protocol and wore a face mask and gloves while on the ship and sanitized his hands with disinfectant.\u00a0\nHe worked at the quarantine office between Feb. 5 and 7 and developed a fever on Feb. 9. He went to a medical institution the following day where he tested positive for the coronavirus. Those who were in close contact with the quarantine officer, such as his family and colleagues, were urged to refrain from going outdoors.\u00a0\nHealth ministry officials said four of the 135 crew and passengers who tested positive for the coronavirus by Feb. 10 had developed severe symptoms. The four were all male. One was in his 60s and the others were in their 70s. Three of them are Japanese. All four had pre-existing health problems and are now in an ICU using oxygen masks.\u00a0\nBased on this new development, health ministry officials are considering allowing senior citizens with pre-existing health conditions to leave the ship even if they display no symptoms of the coronavirus ahead of the scheduled Feb. 19 end to the quarantine period.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Lancet Public Health:\u00a0Authoritarianism, outbreaks, and information politics.\nAre autocratic states such as China better equipped than their more democratic counterparts to respond to disease outbreaks? On Dec 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province. The epidemic quickly spread, with cases of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) confirmed throughout China and elsewhere in Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia. The Chinese Government's forceful response has drawn praise from global health officials. Scholars and health leaders have long debated whether democracy improves, hinders, or is immaterial for public health. Does this signal an authoritarian advantage in tackling outbreaks?\u00a0\nOn the surface, the power of authoritarianism is on display in China's response to 2019-nCoV. The Huanan seafood market suspected as the outbreak source was closed and decontaminated within a day of the announcement. Within 3 days of confirmed human-to-human transmission, with cases rising and the world's largest mass travel event underway for the lunar new year Spring Festival, the Chinese Government imposed an unprecedented cordon sanitaire.\u00a0\nMovement of more than 50 million people across Hubei province was rapidly restricted, curtailing transportation inside cities and outbound transportation by air, train, and bus. Authorities halted Spring Festival celebrations in Beijing and restricted movement into other major cities. Two 1000-bed hospitals were built within days. These moves reflect a level of control only available to authoritarian governments. WHO officials have congratulated China for setting \u201ca new standard for outbreak response\u201d.\u00a0\nYet, time is key to controlling outbreaks; getting good information and acting on it rapidly can halt outbreaks before they need emergency measures. The early history of the 2019-nCoV outbreak raises questions about whether this situation is an example of beneficial autocracy.\u00a0\nFor Amartya Sen, authoritarian states face serious challenges in information and accountability. Governments in closed political systems, without open media and opposition parties, struggle to receive accurate information in a timely manner and to convey urgent information to the public. Governments can be the victims of their own propaganda, because the country's political institutions provide incentives to local officials to avoid sharing bad news with their central bosses and await instructions before acting.\u00a0\nInformation politics in China undermined a rapid response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Health-care workers suspected an outbreak in early December, 2019, but information with which the public might have taken preventive measures was suppressed, and communication channels that might have alerted senior officials to the growing threat were shut down. Police detained a clinician and seven other people posting reports on 2019-nCoV, threatening punishment for spreading so-called rumors. Social media was censored; a preliminary analysis of Weibo and WeChat published on China's biggest online platform showed outbreak discussions were nearly non-existent through much of January, 2020, until the Chinese Government changed its official stance on Jan 20, 2020.\u00a0\nThrough much of January, 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported no evidence of human-to-human transmission, no infection among health workers, that severe cases of disease caused by 2019-nCoV infection were confined to those with underlying conditions and older people, and that the Huanan seafood market was the source. Reports in The Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine, however, show that half of patients admitted to intensive-care units were aged 25\u201349 years, and two-thirds had no underlying illnesses. Human-to-human transmission and health-worker infection were evident before the Chinese Government made an announcement.\u00a0\nThis information either did not make it to authorities or the public were misinformed. The Mayor of Wuhan has said publicly that not only was information not revealed in a timely manner but also they did not use information effectively. By the time quarantine went into effect on Jan 23, 2020, five million people had left the city of Wuhan for holiday travel. Outbreaks were subsequently reported throughout China.\u00a0\nWithout open media and an opposition to check on bureaucratic hierarchy, knowledge from the front lines of the 2019-nCoV outbreak did not reach Beijing. Weeks into the outbreak, leaders were forced to publicly threaten that officials withholding information \u201cwill be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity\u201d.\u00a0\nIs there an authoritarian advantage in disease response? It seems that authoritarian information politics inhibited a rapid response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China, which could have limited the crisis. It is not yet clear if the extraordinary cordons and influx of resources enabled by autocratic rule will prove a successful public health strategy. Yet, in building capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks, democratic openness and competitive politics seem more asset than inadequacy.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia Caixin Global:\u00a0Evidence Mounts of Japan\u2019s Mishandling of Coronavirus Epidemic. Excerpt:\nIt\u2019s 6:26 p.m., Feb. 7. On Twitter, Matthew Smith, a passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, shares a picture of what looks to be his dinner. Smoked salmon, bread, salad, mashed potatoes and even cake. \u00a0\nHe, along with some 3,766 passengers and crew have been quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, due to the discovery of the new coronavirus among passengers. But unlike some of his neighbors, he did not mind the situation.\u00a0\n\u201cYou might have to drag me off the ship when the quarantine ends,\u201d he captioned his meal.\u00a0\nEleven days later, after hundreds aboard the vessel have tested positive for the pathogen, now called Covid-19, Smith still appears to feel the same way.\u00a0\nUnlike most of the roughly 380 U.S. nationals aboard, he has declined an offer by the U.S. government to evacuate off the ship, which now hosts the largest Covid-19 cluster outside of China. As of Monday, two charter planes were en route from Japan to the U.S. Over the weekend, Canada announced similar plans to evacuate its own, and on Tuesday morning, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said their governments would follow suit. \u00a0\nSince confining the Diamond Princess off the coast of the port city earlier this month, Japan\u2019s number of Covid-19 infections, including those on the ship, has soared \u2014 first into the dozens, surpassing its then-relatively hard-hit neighbors in Asia, later rising into a class of its own, rocketing past 600 cases as of Tuesday. \u00a0\nBy Tuesday evening, the number of confirmed infections on the Diamond Princess alone had reached 542, but for some, the situation had long been seen as dire.\u00a0\nAccording to data from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, those aged 60 and above made up more than 80% of the ship\u2019s guests. Following the Feb. 5 order for a 14-day quarantine during which passengers were confined to their rooms, many aboard no longer received bedding or had their rooms cleaned, and those in inner cabins without windows were forced to turn to air conditioning for ventilation, widely perceived as a cross-contamination risk. \u00a0\nDuring this time, Japanese health officials tested a few hundred individuals a day for the virus, mostly relying on a system of identifying those with ties to infected individuals, rather than shifting to screen all onboard, despite finding dozens of positive cases each time. Until this past weekend, those that had tested negative for Covid-19 were still forced to stay on the ship along with those whose status was unknown.\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, the Japanese authorities do not show the innovative miracles that everyone expected from them and act in a chaotic, unsystematic manner,\u201d Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Russian radio last week, addressing concerns for the reportedly 24 Russian nationals onboard the Diamond Princess.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not just the authorities\u2019 handling of the Diamond Princess that has drawn scrutiny, though its passengers now near the end of their quarantine, scheduled for Wednesday for most. \u00a0\nYoshiro Mori, president of the organizing committee of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has personally tried to reassure the public that safety measures were in place to allow the games to go ahead in July as planned.\nAcross the country, the list of those infected no longer stops at taxi and bus drivers, tour guides, doctors and quarantine officers who have been in direct contact with the sick. After confirming its first death of a Covid-19 patient last week, the Japanese government admitted over the weekend that authorities couldn\u2019t explain how a few of the country\u2019s infected individuals had contracted the virus. Despite repeated questions from journalists over multiple days, health minister Katsunobu Kato stopped short of saying that the disease had spread locally, citing ongoing investigations.\u00a0\nAs of Sunday, the ministry still did not label Covid-19 as an epidemic in the country.\u00a0\nMasahiro Kami, president of Japan\u2019s Medical Governance Research Institute, called the Japanese government\u2019s shortcomings a blunder on the operational level. \u00a0\nFor one, Japanese officials directing the country\u2019s health response do not have medical experience. Before being elected to the House of Representatives, Kato was a long-time bureaucrat in the country\u2019s Ministry of Finance.\u00a0\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases, a body under the health ministry that has been tasked with Covid-19 screenings, is also ill-equipped due to its original function as a research organization. For it to conduct large numbers of health exams \u201cwas impossible right from the start,\u201d Kami said. \u00a0\nJapanese researchers in interviews have cited the same bottleneck in the Yokohama region\u2019s ability to confirm Covid-19 results in the lab that have been found elsewhere, namely in China.\n",

The passengers will depart on Wednesday and will be required to be quarantined for another 14 days.\u00a0\n\u2022 Taiwan said today it would charter a plane to evacuate its citizens from the Diamond Princess.

After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine. After evacuating 215 people earlier, the country flew back 185 Canadians from Wuhan on 11 February. All evacuees are quarantined on the Trenton, Ontario base for two weeks.\u00a0\n\u2022 The United States flew back over 300 Americans who had been stuck on the Diamond Princess. They will face two more weeks of quarantine, after spending the previous 14 days docked in Japan. The US also authorised the voluntary departure of its government employees and their family members from Hong Kong on 11 February. On 6 February, two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly US citizens, took off from Wuhan for the United States.\u00a0\n\u2022 Hong Kong said it will send an aircraft to Japan to bring back passengers from the Diamond Princess, which has seen the most coronavirus infections outside of China.\n",

            "main_text": "\n\nVia The Lancet Infectious Diseases:\u00a0An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time. The dashboard is already in the COVD-19 Links list.\nIn December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70\u2008000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.\u00a0\nIn response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time.\u00a0\nThe dashboard, first shared publicly on Jan 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. All data collected and displayed are made freely available, initially through Google Sheets and now through a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the Esri Living Atlas.\u00a0\nThe dashboard reports cases at the province level in China; at the city level in the USA, Australia, and Canada; and at the country level otherwise. During Jan 22\u201331, all data collection and processing were done manually, and updates were typically done twice a day, morning and night (US Eastern Time). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1, we adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy.\u00a0\nOur primary data source is DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases in near real time at the province level in China and at the country level otherwise. Every 15 min, the cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China and for other affected countries and regions.\u00a0\nFor countries and regions outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we found DXY cumulative case counts to frequently lag behind other sources; we therefore manually update these case numbers throughout the day when new cases are identified. To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard.\u00a0\nBefore manually updating the dashboard, we confirm the case numbers with regional and local health departments, including the respective centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of China, Taiwan, and Europe, the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Macau Government, and WHO, as well as city-level and state-level health authorities. For city-level case reports in the USA, Australia, and Canada, which we began reporting on Feb 1, we rely on the US CDC, the government of Canada, the Australian Government Department of Health, and various state or territory health authorities. All manual updates (for countries and regions outside mainland China) are coordinated by a team at Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe case data reported on the dashboard aligns with the daily Chinese CDC3 and WHO situation reports2 for within and outside of mainland China, respectively (figure). Furthermore, the dashboard is particularly effective at capturing the timing of the first reported case of COVID-19 in new countries or regions (appendix). With the exception of Australia, Hong Kong, and Italy, the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University has reported newly infected countries ahead of WHO, with Hong Kong and Italy reported within hours of the corresponding WHO situation report.\u00a0\nGiven the popularity and impact of the dashboard to date, we plan to continue hosting and managing the tool throughout the entirety of the COVID-19 outbreak and to build out its capabilities to establish a standing tool to monitor and report on future outbreaks. We believe our efforts are crucial to help inform modelling efforts and control measures during the earliest stages of the outbreak.\n",

Excerpt from a long summary of a bad day:\nVirus spread and reactions\u00a0 / \u00a0\n\u2022 Confirmed cases in China climbed to 75,572 as of Friday evening. The official death toll reached 2,239. \u00a0\n\u2022 Outside China, 1,224 confirmed cases and 11 deaths were reported in 26 countries. \u00a0\n\u2022 At least five of China\u2019s prisons confirmed 512 cases of Covid-19 infections by Friday, stoking fears that the country\u2019s penitentiaries risk becoming incubators of a virus that appears to run rampant in close quarters. \u00a0\nAn official of the Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice along with provincial officials confirmed figures in online announcements and at a Friday press conference (link in Chinese).\u00a0\n\u2022 Hubei provincial party committee secretary Ying Yong is moving to ban and reverse (link in Chinese) the retroactive deduction of confirmed Covid-19 cases from official data as the province\u2019s drastic changes to epidemic accounting methods in recent days drew criticism.\u00a0\nCases that have already been removed must be added back, and data must be publicized in a transparent and accurate manner, he said Friday at a press conference.\u00a0\n\u2022 \u00a0Reports of a series of new infections in Beijing sparked fears over the capital\u2019s exposure to mounting risks of the deadly coronavirus and have led to large-scale quarantines in at least two downtown hospitals. \u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Exemptions to a 14-day quarantine are being made for certain foreigners returning to Beijing, as China slowly resumes work following the extended Lunar New Year holiday to slow the spread of the virus. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Friday it received updated quarantine rules from the Beijing Covid-19 Prevention and Control Office. \u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0South Korea: The country\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 48 more cases Friday afternoon, bringing South Korea\u2019s total to 204 cases. The country also announced its second death. \u00a0\nThe South Korean government designated the southeastern city of Daegu and the nearby town of Cheongdo as \u201cspecial management zones\u201d after dozens of cases and a possible \u201csuper-spreader\u201d were found in the cities, elevating the country\u2019s infections to the third-highest in the world.\u00a0\n\u2022 Japan: Two children, who are brothers, along with an adult in Japan\u2019s northern island of Hokkaido were diagnosed with Covid-19, local media reported Friday afternoon. This is the first time a person under the age of 10 has been infected in Japan. \u00a0\nAs of Friday evening, Japan had 737 infections. Meanwhile, more sports events have been modified or canceled, fueling fears that the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics could be affected. \u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0U.S.: The first American to be diagnosed with Covid-19 has recovered, local authorities said Thursday (link in Chinese). \u00a0\n\u2022 Iran: Iran confirmed 13 more Covid-19 cases and two more deaths Friday, bringing totals to 18 cases and four deaths, Reuters reported, citing Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur. \u00a0\n\u2022 Ukraine: Buses carrying Ukrainian evacuees were attacked en route to quarantine in a small town in the Eastern European country, the BBC reported. Some 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals were evacuated Thursday from Wuhan, according to the report. Ukraine has not reported any Covid-19 cases. \u00a0\n\u2022 Australia: Two Australians evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan tested positive for Covid-19 upon landing in their home country, local health officials said Friday, bringing Australia\u2019s total to 17.\u00a0\n\u2022 Thousands of Covid-19 cases may have gone undiagnosed in the early stages of the epidemic because of an overemphasis on patients\u2019 contacts with the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, according to doctors fighting the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\n",

The Japanese certainly seemed to have failed every challenge the virus has offered them. Well, in fairness they didn't quarantine the passengers in the long-abandoned houses around the Fukushima nuclear reactor. Excerpt:\nTOKYO, Japan \u2014 Around 100 more passengers were allowed to disembark from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship on Saturday as Japan\u2019s health minister apologised after 23 others were allowed to leave without being properly tested. \u00a0\nThe news came as a Japanese woman who left the ship on Wednesday tested positive for the virus after returning home to Tochigi Prefecture, Kyodo news agency reported, citing the prefectural government.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe is the first person to have tested positive for the virus among the group of approximately 970 passengers who disembarked earlier this week, it said. \u00a0\nThe 100 passengers who left on Saturday had been in close contact with infected people on board, local media said. \u00a0\nThey included the last group of Japanese passengers to leave the ship, while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for their governments to send chartered aircraft.\u00a0\u00a0\nTelevision footage showed a driver in a white protective suit at the wheel of a bus with the curtains drawn so that passengers could not be identified.\u00a0\nThey will be quarantined for two weeks near Tokyo, officials said.\u00a0\nAn official apology\u00a0\nAt a news conference on Saturday, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato apologised for 23 passengers having been allowed to leave the ship without undergoing all the required tests. \u00a0\n\u201cWe deeply regret that our operational mistake caused the situation,\u201d Kato said, adding that the passengers would be tested again.\u00a0\nWith the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still on board. \u00a0\nMany of them were not placed in isolation as they were needed to keep the ship running \u2014 preparing food and delivering meals to cabins. Critics have charged that they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease.\u00a0\u00a0\nKato defended Japan\u2019s on-board quarantine, telling a TV programme Saturday there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3,000 people at once. \u00a0\nSpeaking at the news conference, Kato said six Australian passengers tested positive after leaving Japan.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, 18 repatriated Americans and one Israeli who returned home from the ship have tested positive, authorities from the two countries announced Friday.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Guardian:\u00a0Queensland University casual teachers 'lose 17 weeks work' over coronavirus ban. Excerpt and then a comment:\nCasual staff at the University of Queensland have lost 17 weeks of work while students stranded in China have received letters warning them they will fail if they don\u2019t pay semester fees on time, a teacher at the university has said.\u00a0\nApproximately 40 casual teaching staff at the University Of Queensland\u2019s Institute of Continuing and TESOL Education (ICTE) have been affected as the Australian government\u2019s ban on travellers from mainland China causes an unprecedented drop in student numbers. \u00a0\nThe coronavirus-driven travel ban, which is about to enter its fourth week, has affected some 6,300 students at the University of Queensland. The ICTE provides English language training, including bridging programs for international students who wish to go on to study at the university.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrancine Chidgey, a casual teacher at ICTE, told Guardian Australia that she and other members of staff had had their shifts cut without warning since the travel ban was instituted.\u00a0\n\u201cAbout half our students are from China, mostly in bridging English,\u201d said Chidgey.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told that I won\u2019t have teaching shifts for 17 weeks. About 40 of my colleagues are in the same position, with others receiving only one or two days\u2019 work per week, and occasional relief work.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe travel restrictions have hit the higher education sector particularly hard, with universities reportedly projecting $1.2bn in lost fees from an estimated 65,800 international students at risk of cancelling their enrolment due to being stranded outside Australia. The government has said it will consider relaxing the ban at the end of the month.\u00a0\nChidgey said that in previous years staff at ICTE could expect at least a few shifts per week at this time of year. \u00a0\nHer comments echoed those made by a lecturer at the University of Sydney on Wednesday, who said casual staff there were \u201cpanicking\u201d at the prospect of lost shifts, and that many who were still working were resorting to \u201cunsustainable\u201d methods of communicating with students who were stuck overseas. \u00a0\n\u201cIn other departments, colleagues have told me they\u2019re snowed under trying to adapt materials for lectures and tutorials to be offered online. They haven\u2019t been paid overtime for this demanding work,\u201d Chidgey said.\u00a0\nStranded students were also concerned that they couldn\u2019t access the websites they needed from China except through VPN, and that sites themselves, such as Blackboard \u2013 a common online educational tool used by universities \u2013 are confusing and frustrating, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cNo clear instructions have been emailed to them. As a teacher I agree the websites are not set out intuitively and are frustrating to navigate,\u201d Chidgey said.\u00a0\nShe said students who have been stuck in China due to the coronavirus travel ban have also received emails warning that they would fail the semester if they did not pay their fees on time.\u00a0\nChidgey said the tone of the emails was \u201ccompletely insensitive\u201d. \u00a0\n\u201cMy students told me they\u2019re disappointed by the university\u2019s response, and that the academic and financial stress was exacerbating their stress over the health crisis itself.\u00a0\n\u201cThis has been done to safeguard the university\u2019s profits. It certainly hasn\u2019t been done to deliver a quality online educational experience to Chinese students affected by the travel ban, or to pay overtime to other staff struggling to provide supplementary online materials themselves without proper resourcing or support.\u201d\nNorth American schools face the same prospect, as I mentioned in a recent Tyee article. And like the Australians, our post-secondaries will dump the burden on temporary faculty\u2014also called seasonal, adjuncts, and other genteel euphemisms for underpaid, overworked academics who lack tenure and scrape along from semester to semester.\nIt's a lousy deal even in good times, and in times like these it shows that much of our young professariat are really just part of the precariat.\n",

They will spend two weeks in quarantine in Darwin.\n***\nPakistan has closed its land border with Iran, as Afghanistan suspends travel to the neighbouring country amid concerns about the growing numbers of people being infected by new coronavirus.\u00a0\n\u201cTo prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public, Afghanistan suspends all passenger movement (air and ground) to and from Iran,\u201d the office of the National Security Council of Afghanistan said in a statement posted on Twitter. \u00a0\nA provincial official in Pakistan and the country\u2019s Frontier Corps also confirmed that the country had sealed the land border with Iran. \u00a0\nIran has now had eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus, bringing the overall number of infections to 43.\u00a0\nFour new infections surfaced in the capital Tehran, seven in the holy city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said.\u00a0\nAuthorities have ordered as a \u201cpreventive measure\u201d the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces across Iran from Sunday. \u00a0\nAfghanistan and Pakistan share porous borders with Iran that are often used by smugglers and human traffickers, while millions of Afghan refugees currently live in the Islamic Republic. Fears were raised that the virus could easily spread over the border.\u00a0\nHealth authorities said that 18 of the 39 South Koreans from the south-eastern region who had made a group pilgrimage to sites in Israel later tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\n***\nIsrael\u2019s foreign ministry issued added warnings about travel to South Korea and Japan due to the coronavirus, and the health ministry is ordering Israelis returning from those countries to remain in home quarantine. This was previously ordered for those returning from Hong Kong, China, Macau, Thailand and Singapore. \u00a0\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be adding additional restrictions on entry to Israel from countries including Australia and Japan.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The New York Times:\u00a0Global Stocks Plummet Over Coronavirus Concerns. Excerpt and then a comment:\nSpreading coronavirus outbreaks in Italy and in South Korea over the weekend incited broad slides in global stock markets on Monday, as investors feared that the economic disruption already seen in China might affect other economies as well.\u00a0\nFutures markets indicated that Wall Street would suffer a steep decline when trading begins in the United States, with airline and technology stocks hit in premarket trading. The S&P 500 is set to fall more than 2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average tumble more than 800 points. Delta Air Lines and American were both more than 3 percent lower, while shares of Apple were down by 3.5 percent. Oil prices also fell as demand for crude waned because of concerns about a widening economic slowdown. \u00a0\nInvestors have been on edge since the start of the crisis because of the outsize role that China\u2019s factories play in global business, as well as being a huge consumer market itself. Markets were sanguine last week, but fresh reports that the virus is not contained are \u201csignaling alarm bells,\u201d a market analyst at Citigroup wrote Monday.\u00a0\nThe South Korean market ended 3.9 percent lower, after a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease prompted President Moon Jae-in on Sunday to put the country on its highest level of alert.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Europe, most stock benchmarks were down 3 percent or more.\u00a0\nThe FTSE 100 in Britain slid 3 percent, while France\u2019s CAC 40 was down 3.5 percent. The DAX in Germany also fell 3.5 percent.\u00a0\nThe FTSE MIB index, which measures stocks on the Borsa Italiana in Milan, fell 4.6 percent. The Italian government locked down at least 10 towns over the weekend near Milan, the country\u2019s financial capital and a key industrial center, after scores of new cases emerged there.\u00a0\nHaven investments like gold and Treasuries have rallied, while shares in luxury companies like LVMH and Kering have tumbled. Shares in EssilorLuxottica, a French-Italian high-end eyeglass maker, were down almost 5 percent. Shares in travel and leisure groups were also lower. \u00a0\nStock markets in Asia dropped beyond South Korea, although somewhat less. The Australian market fell over 2 percent. Shares in Hong Kong were 1.8 percent lower on Monday afternoon. \u00a0\nStock markets in mainland China seemed mostly immune on Monday to the sell-off elsewhere. The Shanghai stock market was down only slightly. In southeastern China, the tech-heavy Shenzhen stock market actually rose.\nThe Chinese authorities have appeared to prop up the country\u2019s domestic stock markets in recent days after a steep slide when they first reopened following the Lunar New Year holiday, which the Chinese government extended in an effort to stop the outbreak. \u201c\nThe worse the virus outbreak, the better the chance the central bank will release\u201d more money into the financial system, which would tend to support share prices, said Hao Hong, the research director for the international operations of China\u2019s Bank of Communications.\nAs I write this, just before 7:00 a.m. PST, the Dow Jones is down about 830 points.\u00a0 The TSX is down about 270.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Globe and Mail, an excellent article by Globe Asia correspondent Nathan Vanderklippe:\u00a0COVID-19 \u2018not beyond control,' says Canadian WHO official Bruce Aylward. Excerpt:\nGlobal markets are in a panic. Japan has shut down schools. Australia has warned of a pandemic. Italy has locked down towns. South Korea has seen a frightening surge in the number of people sickened by the fast-spreading coronavirus. The World Health Organization has said the global risk posed by the virus that causes COVID-19, now confirmed in 53 countries, is \u201cvery high.\u201d \u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not too late to tame the outbreak, says the Canadian doctor who headed a WHO team to China\u2019s Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat China demonstrates is that this one is not beyond control. It\u2019s a function of your response,\u201d said Bruce Aylward, who led an independent fact-finding mission to study the spread of the virus in China, as well as that country\u2019s response.\nCOVID-19 spreads so rapidly that one Harvard researcher has warned that 40 to 70 per cent of the world\u2019s adults will be infected. Its deadliness has raised frightening comparisons with the Spanish flu.\u00a0\nBut \u201cwe don\u2019t need to end up there,\u201d said Dr. Aylward, who came away from China convinced that the virus is not spreading as easily as feared and that the outbreak can be arrested if public-health authorities prepare well and act swiftly. In China and elsewhere, there is little evidence of widespread community transmission, he said. Instead, \u201cit is more a whole bunch of clusters of transmission.\u201d Take the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Or members of a sect in South Korea. Or people living in single buildings in Beijing or Hong Kong.\u00a0\nThat, he said, \u201cis really important. Because you can get on top of that.\u201d\u00a0\nBut to do so, \u201cspeed is everything here.\u201d Dr. Aylward joined the WHO in 1992 and has spent his career working on infectious diseases, polio eradication and preparedness.\u00a0\nHe spoke to The Globe and Mail from Geneva, after his return this week from China, whose unprecedented response he has praised publicly. Chinese authorities have shut down most of Hubei and have imposed severe restrictions on movements and daily life in cities and villages across the country.\u00a0\nChinese officials initially waited weeks to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19, with police even arresting doctors for discussing the appearance of a dangerous new virus.\nSince then, however, China has responded with a speed unmatched any where else, Dr. Aylward said. He saw control rooms where authorities responding to the crisis deftly marshalled real-time statistical information with access to front-line workers. He heard from authorities who described graduated responses, with measures that varied depending on the severity of local outbreaks. \u00a0\nIn Hubei, the problem is severe.\u00a0\nBut China has 31 other provinces and regions. \u201cAlmost none of the other provinces look like what other areas outside of China are looking like,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd other countries had a month and a half of notice.\u201d\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia Caixin Global, a summary of an eventful day:\u00a0Coronavirus Live Updates | Saturday: China PMIs Hits Historic Low, Iran and South Korea Outbreaks Grow.\nSaturday, Feb. 29, 9:00 p.m.\u00a0\nThere was ugly economic news today from China\u2019s top statistics bureau, which reported that its purchasing managers indexes had fallen to their lowest levels on record.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, worrying outbreaks in Iran and South Korea continued to spiral, researchers in Wuhan released new data from autopsies, and HNA Group\u2019s debt was taken over by the Hainan provincial government as the outbreak\u2019s impact on the travel industry brought the once powerful grey rhino to its knees. \u00a0\nChinese purchasing indexes drop to historic lows\u00a0 \nChinese factory activity fell off a cliff in February, figures released by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics on Feb. 29 show (link in Chinese).\u00a0\nThe manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index tumbled to 35.7 in February from 50 the previous month, far lower than economists had expected. The gauge for non-manufacturing sectors fell even further \u2014 down 24.5 points to 29.6.\u00a0\nThe indexes for both sectors fell to their lowest point since the purchasing manager survey was launched in 2005, dragging the comprehensive index down 24.1 points to 28.9.\u00a0\nBeijing suspends taxi services out of city\u00a0 \nBeijing has banned taxi and ride-hailing services from transporting passengers out of the city until further notice to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\u00a0\nThe city transport commission said it would focus on unlicensed taxis, saying it had seized 51 such vehicles carrying passengers between provinces between Feb. 9 and 27.\u00a0\nRide-hailing giant Didi Chuxing had suspended interprovincial operations on Jan. 26 in response to new regulations, but other companies such as Tida Chuxing, as well as unlicensed taxis, had continued to provide rides across city borders. \u00a0\nIn other coronavirus news\u00a0 \n\u2022 The total number of cases in Iran jumped by more than 50% to 593 with the death toll climbing to 43 today, Bloomberg reported. Among those who have tested positive were five members of the Iranian parliament, which indefinitely suspended all sessions Friday.\u00a0\n\u2022 Early Saturday morning a five-member Chinese Red Cross volunteer team arrived in the Iranian capital of Tehran with medical aid, according to China\u2019s embassy in the city. Iranian Health Minister Saeed Namaki said Iran\u2019s outbreak would peak in the coming week as he called on people in the country to reduce travel, and said schools would stay closed until at least March 2.\u00a0\n\u2022 Researchers from Tongji Medical College in quarantined Wuhan say autopsies have found large amounts of mucus deep in the lungs of patients who died of Covid-19. The team believes the mucus impairs the ability of patients to breathe and must be dissolved or removed during treatment (link in Chinese). \u00a0\n\u2022 The government of Hainan has taken over the management of HNA Group\u2019s debt after coronavirus fears and travel bans eroded its airline business (link in Chinese), the group\u2019s main remaining source of income.\u00a0\n\u2022 The number of people diagnosed in South Korea climbed more than 35% over the past 24 hours, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control adding 813 cases on Saturday. \u00a0\n\u2022 China's National Health Commission said (link in Chinese) hospitals and other areas most impacted by the new coronavirus should prioritize prevention and treatment, but must also ensure provision of medical services for cancer patients and kidney disease as well as those with other issues. Lower risk regions should shift their focus back to provision of basic medical services. Caixin previously reported on patients with life-threatening kidney disease going without care in virus-ravaged Wuhan. \u00a0\n\u2022 International oil prices plummeted, representing the biggest weekly drop in four years on worries about the slowdown in growth in demand for crude oil as planes are grounded and factories grind to a halt (link in Chinese).\n\nSaturday, Feb. 29, 12:00 p.m.\nChina\u2019s official coronavirus infection count edged up to 79,389 on Saturday as more than 400 new cases were added, representing a significant slowing in the rate of infection.\nAuthorities say only four new cases of coronavirus were diagnosed outside of Hubei province in its most recent one-day count for Feb. 28. The China-wide total was 427, remaining under 500 for the fourth consecutive day.\nForty-seven more people died from the respiratory disease in China, meaning 2,838 people have now succumbed to it since the first cases were identified in December. The number of new deaths from the virus has remained in double digits in recent days.\nASEAN meeting in Las Vegas cancelled\nThe U.S. has canceled a meeting between President Donald Trump and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas planned for March 14 over coronavirus fears, multiple U.S. news outlets are reporting.\n\u201cAs the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN leaders meeting previously scheduled for mid-March. The United States values our relationships with the nations of this critical region, and looks forward to future meetings,\u201d CNN reported a senior Trump official as saying.\nThe meeting was announced after the U.S. president failed to attend a November summit with the group in Bangkok.\nAccording to CNN, no specific plans have been announced but President Trump may hold bilateral meetings in Las Vegas.\nIn other coronavirus news\n\u2022 Iranian Ministry of Health spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour accused the BBC of spreading lies after the broadcaster reported 210 people in Iran have died as a result of coronavirus, citing health system sources. That's six times Iran's official death toll of 34, already the highest of any country outside China.\n\u2022 A third case of Covid-19 was diagnosed Friday in the Los Angeles, California county of Santa Clara. The patient had no known exposure to the virus through travel or contact with an infected person, raising concerns about possible community transmission. The elderly woman was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms.\n\u2022 Health authorities in the Australian state of Queensland have asked patrons of a Gold Coast beauty salon to come forward after a 63-year-old woman who worked there fell ill with the coronavirus. Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeanette Young told a press conference the woman had recently returned from Iran.\n\u2022 Google will ban business travel to and from Japan and South Korea starting March 2, Bloomberg reported citing a company memo. Amazon has also asked its employees to defer non-essential travel.\n\u2022 U.S. stocks saw their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping to its lowest point since June, and S&P500 plunging 11%, according to Bloomberg.\n\u2022 A Caixin feature shows how civil society has stepped in to help Wuhan\u2019s coronavirus relief effort. University alumni groups, dedicated disaster relief teams and volunteers organizing online have played a key role in fighting the epidemic.\n\n",
