            "main_text": "\nVia The Washington Post:\u00a0Coronavirus latest: China tries to close off Wuhan, city at the center of outbreak. Excerpt:\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese health authorities sought to impose a quasi-quarantine Tuesday around Wuhan, advising people in the city of 11 million people not to leave, as they stepped up efforts to stop the spread of a mystery virus that has claimed six lives. \u00a0\nWith confirmation that the pneumonialike coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, and with hundreds of millions of Chinese packing onto public transport to make their annual pilgrimages home for the Lunar New Year, a new sense of panic has erupted here. \u00a0\nLong lines formed at pharmacies and convenience stores around the country as people rushed to buy surgical masks, with unlucky customers posting photos on social media of bare shelves. People around the country canceled their trips home for the Spring Festival, as new year celebrations are known, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really dare to go to the airport right now, or even to the movie theater,\u201d said Xie Jing, 33, who works in advertising in Shanghai, where there have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus. She canceled her planned trip home to Sichuan, where two cases are suspected.\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone is being very careful at the moment in Shanghai. Everyone is wearing masks on the streets,\u201d Xie said. \u00a0\nThe Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would call an emergency meeting Wednesday to decide whether to designate the outbreak as an international public health emergency. Australia and the Philippines are the latest countries with suspected cases of the infection, and Taiwan also confirmed one person there had caught it.\nThe virus was first detected on Dec. 31 and was linked to a dirty food market in Wuhan, not far from one of the city\u2019s main train stations, where wild animals including wolf pups and civet cats had been on sale for consumption.\nThe number of people in China confirmed to have the virus topped 300 on Tuesday, according to the National Health Commission, an increase of more than 70 from Monday. The vast majority of cases are in Wuhan, where Mayor Zhou Xianwang said six people have now died from the virus. \u00a0\nWuhan\u2019s three major hospitals have 800 beds, but authorities said they would add 1,200 beds to deal with the rising number of pneumonia cases. They also said they would foot the hospital bills for those infected.\nInitially, doctors thought that the virus was not communicable between humans, but cases of infection across the country, including among people who have not been to Wuhan, proved that it can be passed on.\u00a0\nSome 60 people across 15 provinces are being monitored for possible infection, with cases found as far afield as Dalian in the northeast and Chongqing in the southwest, as well as in the metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.\u00a0\u00a0\nSpecialists are urging travelers not to move in and out of the central Chinese city.\u00a0\n\u201cWe hope people can avoid going to Wuhan if possible and that people in Wuhan can stay there,\u201d said Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the leader of a government team of experts responding to the outbreak. \u201cThis is not a call from the officials but a suggestion from us in the expert team,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nStill, he said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the virus would continue to spread as people moved around the country for the turning of the Lunar New Year on Saturday. \u00a0\nThe Ministry of Transport estimates that 400 million people will be on the move, making a total of 3 billion trips during this period.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Globe and Mail:\u00a0Weeks before lockdown, Wuhan authorities used 'refrigerating strategy\u2019 to downplay coronavirus. Excerpt:\nAs Chinese authorities widened a massive urban lockdown and flew large numbers of medical personnel to Wuhan, the epicentre of a new SARS-like virus, medical authorities provided new indications that weeks of inaction had allowed the virus to spread widely before serious measures were taken.\u00a0\nChinese authorities initially reported that the new 2019-nCoV coronavirus had most seriously affected the elderly and those left vulnerable by pre-existing health conditions. \u00a0\nBut an academic study published by Chinese researchers in The Lancet on Friday found that of the first 41 confirmed cases of the virus, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, \u201cless than half had underlying diseases.\u201d Nearly half were 49 years of age or younger. And a third had not been exposed to the wild animal market identified as the source of virus, suggesting that even from the earliest days, it had begun to leap between people.\u00a0\u00a0\nFifteen per cent of those first 41 people died. \u00a0\n\u201cWe are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission,\u201d warned the paper\u2019s authors, who included dozens of doctors from hospitals in Wuhan and major state institutes for infectious disease research.\u00a0\nThe first of the patients was admitted to hospital on Dec. 16, more than a month before Chinese authorities began to lock down Wuhan and neighbouring cities in Hubei province. \u00a0\nBy Saturday evening, nearly all of Hubei, with a population of 58 million, was under some form of lockdown, with authorities halting most forms of transportation and barring entry and exit to at least 15 cities. China has counted 1,369 confirmed cases and 41 deaths. New cases have also been confirmed in Malaysia, Australia, Nepal, France, Singapore and the U.S.\u00a0\nThe growing reach of the virus comes after weeks of inaction in Wuhan, where it is believed to have originated at a market selling wild animals. Though China has been credited for an unusual degree of transparency in the past week, virologists have faulted the country for acting too slowly in the early days of its spread, allowing infected people to travel widely inside and outside Wuhan. \u00a0\nNow, new evidence is emerging that officials in Wuhan deliberately downplayed the virus, even after formally notifying the World Health Organization on Dec. 31 about what the WHO described as \u201ca cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.\u201d \u00a0\nBut the Wuhan government took a \u201crefrigerating strategy\u201d in the early days of the viral spread, a doctor at Wuhan Union Hospital told China News Weekly. Medical staff were banned from speaking publicly about what was taking place or accepting media interviews, the doctor said.\u00a0\nPolice in Wuhan also said in early January that they had arrested eight people for spreading \u201crumours\u201d about what was then a little-understood pneumonia affecting a growing number of people.\u00a0\nAnother person claiming to be a Wuhan physician wrote to the National Health Commission this week claiming that doctors in the city were told not to report \u201cviral pneumonia\u201d in their imaging reports between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16 \u2014 a period during which local officials delivered sunny reports on a local situation under control. That meant that, during a crucial period in which cases were accumulating, local health-care workers were unable to properly raise the alarm, the person wrote. The Globe and Mail was unable to independently verify the report, which was widely circulated in China and not refuted by state media.\u00a0\nA doctor at Wuhan\u2019s Hubei Xinhua hospital has now died from the virus, state media reported Saturday morning. The death of Liang Wudong, 62, comes amid widespread reports of a large number of unreported cases of medical staff infected by the virus, and accusations that an improper dissemination of information kept those treating the ill from taking proper precautions themselves.\n",

Excerpt:\nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called an emergency government meeting, telling officials the country is facing a \u201cgrave situation\u201d as the new coronavirus is \u201caccelerating its spread\u201d. \u00a0\nMore than 50 million people are spending China\u2019s most important holiday under lockdown as the country expands its travel restrictions in an attempt to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.\u00a0\nOfficials confirmed on Saturday, the lunar new year, that the death toll from the viral outbreak had reached 41 and more than 1,200 other people had been affected. \u00a0\nA doctor treating people infected with the virus was among those who died. Liang Wudong, 62, died on Saturday morning, state media said, and it was also reported by the Chinese Global Times website that another doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan died of a heart attack later in the day. \u00a0\nIn Beijing, five new cases have been confirmed, according to Chinese National Radio, including two patients who had not recently travelled to Hubei, the centre of the outbreak. In all previous cases in the capital, patients had reportedly visited the province.\nThe virus is now confirmed to have reached Australia and Malaysia, while France confirmed on Friday that three people there had the virus. Both France and the US plan to evacuate citizens trapped in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the outbreak began. \u00a0\nHong Kong, which has confirmed five cases of the illness, declared the outbreak an emergency on Saturday, and said it would keep primary and secondary schools closed for two more weeks after the holiday.\nA growing number of airports around the world have introduced screening to identify those affected, although the effectiveness of such measures has been questioned. An article published in the Lancet, based on a family that had recently visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, suggested it was possible to have the disease while not experiencing any symptoms. \u00a0\nAcross China, the lunar new year holiday has been overshadowed by travel blocks imposed on at least 17 cities, and the cancellation of major festive events. In an effort to stop the disease from spreading further, part of the Great Wall was closed, and Beijing\u2019s temple fairs, a new year tradition, have been cancelled. Shanghai Disneyland also announced it would close indefinitely.\u00a0\nIt is feared the lunar new year, when hundreds of millions of people go on holiday or to visit relatives, could fuel the spread of the virus across China and abroad.\u00a0\nSo far, 29 provinces and cities in China have been affected, and further cases had been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The US reported its second case.\n",

She is currently in a government hospital, where she was admitted on January 25, but was no longer showing symptoms. \u00a0\nDOH Epidemiology Bureau Director Ferchito Avelino said authorities would check the establishments that she went to and trace employees she had been in contact with.\u00a0\nThe samples from the Chinese woman were among the 6 sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia for testing earlier this week. The 5 others tested negative.\u00a0\nSucceeding tests for 2019-nCoV will now be done by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), as the DOH has already acquired the necessary test kit for the procedure, the results of which may be available within 24 hours of testing.\n",
