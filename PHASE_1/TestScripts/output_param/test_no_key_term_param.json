            "main_text": "\n\nVia the South China Morning Post, a Bloomberg/AFP report:\u00a0Australia braces for \u2018more damage, more destruction\u2019 as all visitors to southeast coast urged to evacuate worsening bush fires. Excerpt:\nThousands of tourists holidaying on the south coast of Australia have been told to evacuate before another heatwave over the weekend expected to intensify deadly wildfires sweeping through the region.\u00a0\nIn an unprecedented appeal, the Rural Fire Service said anyone in the southeastern tip of New South Wales state should get out in the next two days with more extreme weather expected on the weekend.\u00a0\nThe 230km (143-mile) stretch from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria state border has been ravaged by fires this week, as infernos turned the sky blood red and rained down embers and ash on communities.\u00a0\n\u201cWe cannot overstate the potential risk of more damage and more destruction,\u201d RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Sky News Thursday. \u201cThere is a big effort between today and tomorrow to get as many people out of the south coast as we can.\u201d\u00a0\nSaturday is forecast to bring gusting winds and temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). That weather will create dangerous fire conditions that officials say will be as bad \u2013 if not worse \u2013 than Tuesday, Australia\u2019s deadliest day of fires in a months-long bushfire crisis.\u00a0\nNSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told public broadcaster ABC it would be the \u201clargest evacuation of people out of the region ever\u201d, with thousands preparing to leave ahead of another \u201cterrible\u201d day of fires.\nNSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said firefighters were unable to extinguish or even control the raging blazes.\u00a0\n\u201cThe message is we\u2019ve got so much fire in that area, we have no capacity to contain these fires,\u201d he told ABC.\n\u201cWe just need to make sure that people are not in front of them.\u201d\u00a0\nAt least seven people have been killed on the south coast of New South Wales earlier this week and hundreds of properties destroyed. Thousands of locals and tourists have been stranded in the rural, forested region at the peak of the summer holiday season.\u00a0\nFitzsimmons said the main highway to the north was now mostly open, and as power was restored, gas stations would be able to dispense fuel to motorists.\u00a0\nIsolated communities in Victoria remain cut-off by road, including the township of Mallacoota, where some 4,000 people were forced to shelter on the beach or escape by boat as wildfires swept through.\u00a0\nNavy ships and military aircraft have been deployed alongside emergency crews to provide humanitarian relief and assess the damage.\nMilitary helicopters and ships have been scrambled to bring in supplies and for potential evacuations if roads can\u2019t be reopened.\u00a0\nThe scale of the crisis, played out in real-time on social media as people posted footage and images of raging fire-fronts bearing down on communities, has shocked Australia and fuelled an emotive debate about the impact of global warming in the world\u2019s driest inhabited continent.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s government is coming under sustained criticism from environmentalists and the opposition after repeatedly downplaying any links to climate change, and for not taking stronger steps to curb emissions.\n",

Excerpt:\nA few minutes before midnight on the last day of the year, Pacific daylight time, I began to cry.\nI\u2019m a purportedly \u201cgrown man\u201d and I\u2019m not easily moved to tears, but as is the way with emotions, there wasn\u2019t much I could do when the tears came but to wipe them away and trust that they would stop, which eventually they did. \u00a0\nI cried for my country, for my Lucky Country, the wide brown land, the Fatal Shore \u2014 for Australia. I cried because when I woke up under the Tuscan sun just before 9 a.m. after our New Year\u2019s revels (i.e. just before midnight on Canada\u2019s West Coast, where I live), I looked at my phone and was informed that Australia was on fire as never before.\u00a0\nI know, the fires have been going on for weeks now. I\u2019ve tracked them as best I can from half a world away because my eldest son relocated to Sydney a few months ago to, among other things, escape the foul air of Shanghai and the foul system that passes for government in China; I also have a sister and nephews and their young families in Adelaide, where I was born. They are all okay, in that they still have roofs over their heads and, well, they aren\u2019t dead.\u00a0\nBut what was different on New Year\u2019s Day were fresh accounts from the front of thousands of Australians being herded onto beaches on the south coast of New South Wales \u2014 iconic Australian beaches now serving as the ironic last and only refuges from the pent-up fury of fires that cannot be, will not be controlled.\n",

            "main_text": "\nA statement from the Climate and Health Alliance, signed by 28 Australian health groups:\u00a0Joint Statement: Air pollution in NSW is a public health emergency.\nSmoke from bushfires has produced air pollution of up to 11 times the base \u2018hazardous\u2019 level in parts of Sydney and New South Wales. High levels of air pollution are expected to continue.\u00a0\nThere is no safe level of air pollution. The higher the level of pollution, the more hazardous the risks to health. Bushfire smoke is particularly hazardous because of the high levels of tiny particles (PM2.5).\u00a0\nBabies, young children and those who are elderly or already experience chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease are at higher risk, as are the socially and economically marginalised who may not have access to air conditioning or air purifiers. \u00a0\nAir pollution is linked to diseases throughout life: including premature births, low birth weight babies, impaired lung development in children, asthma, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.\u00a0\nThe levels of air pollution in NSW in recent weeks, and in the immediate future, remain hazardous to people\u2019s health. \u00a0\nThis is a public health emergency \u00a0\nGovernments have a responsibility to protect the people they represent.\u00a0\nBoth the Federal and State Government of NSW must prioritise action to help reduce the risks to people\u2019s health arising from hazardous air pollution from the bushfires that continue to burn relentlessly across the state. \u00a0\nWe call on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to demonstrate the leadership this public health emergency demands, and to implement measures to help alleviate the health and climate crisis. \u00a0\nAuthorities are encouraging people in affected areas to avoid exercise and stay indoors with windows and doors closed and, if they have medication for respiratory conditions, to use their medications as directed. \u00a0\nIn accordance with advice from the NSW Department of Health, if you are particularly susceptible to bushfire smoke, consider staying with a friend or relative whose house has clean indoor air or leaving the area for a cleaner environment. \u00a0\nProtecting health requires climate action \u00a0\nClimate change is worsening many extreme weather events such as serious bushfire weather, which is having devastating impacts on human health.\u00a0\nThe air pollution events resulting from bushfires will become more and more frequent and are a result of climate change. Our governments must act quickly to rapidly and deeply reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which we know are driving climate change.\u00a0\nThis moment calls for political leadership \u00a0\nAll of our political leaders must acknowledge the health and environmental emergency of climate change, and step up and commit to urgent climate action by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with what the science demands. \u00a0\nIn addition to responding to this public health emergency, we call on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Premier Gladys Berejiklian to lead action on climate change to protect our health.\u00a0\nThis must include a multi-portfolio response involving Federal and State governments and the development of a National Strategy on Climate, Health and Well-being. This will ensure a nationally coordinated approach to tackling the worsening health impacts of climate change, and that health service planning includes climate change preparedness to respond to the increasing demand for health services from extreme weather events, such as bushfires and heatwaves.\n",

Excerpt:\nThe NSW energy minister Matt Kean has urged residents across the state to reduce electricity usage as the Berejiklian government scrambles to determine the extent of fire damage to the Snowy Hydro's transmission lines. \u00a0\nThe NSW grid's links to Victoria went down late on Saturday afternoon, with Mr Kean issuing a statement urging all residents to preserve power.\u00a0\n\"The extensive bushfire activity in the Snowy Mountains and other areas of the state have had an impact on our electricity supplies,\u201d Mr Kean said.\u00a0\nJust before 7pm, 14,000 people had lost power in Sydney's north and south-west, and Port Stephens. Greenacre, Campsie, Punchbowl, Hornsby, Chatswood and St Ives were affected, as well as Port Stephens on the Central Coast.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), TransGrid and the NSW and ACT Governments were working closely \"to keep power supplies on\" but weather conditions meant authorities could struggle \"to keep the overall system secure.\u201d\nA senior official within a government agency, who did not want to be identified, told the Herald the transmission from Snowy \"had been taken out\" but a spokesperson for Mr Kean could not confirm the reports. \u00a0\nMr Kean asked consumers to make sure power-hungry pool pumps were turned off, raise air conditioner thermostats to 24 or 25 degrees, refrain from using washing machines, dishwashers or dryers, and turn off appliances and lights not in use.\u00a0\nAEMO was also working with large load electricity customers to reduce their electricity consumption where possible.\u00a0\nIn a statement, AEMO acknowledged that the health and wellbeing of consumers remains the highest priority, so urged consumers to only conserve energy \"if it is safe to do so.\" \u00a0\n\"Should the situation worsen further and AEMO loses all reserves available and energy unavailability continues to risk impacting the security of the National Electricity Market, as a last resort, AEMO may be forced to instruct controlled load shedding in NSW,\" the statement said. \u00a0\nIf the Snowy's ability to transmit power was impacted beyond a temporary hitch, both NSW and Victoria could face regular outages, possibly for weeks.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The New York Times:\u00a0The Flu Season May Yet Turn Ugly, C.D.C. Warns - The New York Times.\nThe United States may be headed into a bad flu season, according to figures recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nAs of the last week of December, \u201cwidespread\u201d flu activity was reported by health departments in 46 states. More ominously, a second measure \u2014 the percentage of patients with flu symptoms visiting medical clinics \u2014 shot up almost to the peak reached at the height of the 2017-18 flu season, which was the most severe in a decade. \u00a0\nAbout 61,000 Americans died of flu that season, the C.D.C. said. (The original estimate of 79,000 was revised downward last year; the agency said the number changed as more death certificate information became available.) \u00a0\nThis year\u2019s flu vaccine may not be particularly effective against the strain of the virus now widespread in the United States, experts said. But even so, it\u2019s worth getting the shot: people who are vaccinated fare better if struck by the flu than those who are not.\nIt is still too early to know how severe this season will be, said Lynnette Brammer, leader of the agency\u2019s domestic influenza surveillance team.\u00a0\nAlthough many people are coming down with flu, the two chief indicators of severity \u2014 hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 are not yet elevated, she noted. \u00a0\nDeaths from pneumonia and flu are actually lower than normal at this time. But reports of hospitalization and death normally lag other indicators by at least two weeks.\u00a0\nThe current season did begin unusually early. By late November, the flu had hit hard in the Deep South, from Texas to Georgia. The virus then broke out in California and the Rocky Mountain states, but was not widespread in the Northeast until recently.\u00a0\nThat pattern echoes what happened in Australia, where winter runs from June through August. Flu came unusually early to the Southern Hemisphere in 2019. In seasons when Australia has a bad flu season, the Northern Hemisphere sometimes does, too.\nIn another important way, however, the United States is not following Australia\u2019s lead. The A(H3N2) strain of influenza was dominant there last year, while most American cases this season have been caused by a very different strain, called B Victoria. (B strains are named for the cities where they were first isolated.) \u00a0\nB strain flus do not normally arrive until late in the season. But when they do, \u201cthey often impact children more than adults and older adults,\u201d Ms. Brammer said. \u00a0\nThe C.D.C. tracks the deaths of children individually, rather than making estimates, as is done for adults. Those over 65 are usually the group hardest hit by flu. Thus far this season, 27 children have died of flu \u2014 in 2017-18, 187 died \u2014 but pediatric deaths don\u2019t normally start peaking until mid-January.\n",

            "main_text": "\nThanks to Dr. Alexandra Phelan to tweeting the link to this deeply disturbing report in The Guardian:\u00a0Being pregnant in a climate emergency was an existential challenge. Miscarriage has brought a new grief. Excerpt:\nOn Boxing Day I had an article published about being pregnant in a climate emergency. It was about the conflicting and contradictory emotions many of us are forced to hold if we choose to take the leap of faith of bringing a child into the world in the midst of climate collapse. \u00a0\nAt the time I wrote that piece, the smoke came and went. Occasionally we caught snippets of blue sky. \u00a0\nWe could still hear birds then. See bees feeding on the summer flowers in our garden. \u00a0\nJust six days later, the house surrounded by a dense glowing orange fog of smoke, my writing felt both prescient and dated. The birds were gone. Canberra, and the wildlife that lives in the national parks that encircle it, was suffocating. Climate collapse wasn\u2019t a slow-moving force my child and I might gradually see impact our lives. It was here, now. Upon us and immediate. \u00a0\nThat was the day the smoke was the thickest. So thick it shut down the whole city, the airport closed, all roads in and out cut off with fire. It was the first day that felt like sunset from start to finish. A colour we\u2019ve come to think of as \u201capocalypse orange\u201d.\u00a0\nWhen, even though no fire had crossed the borders of the Australian Capital Territory, Canberrans had their cars packed to evacuate. Where everyone clutched their iPhones flicking between the live fire reporting and the live air quality reporting. Back, and forth, back and forth \u2026 on and on, we livestreamed the end of the world.\nThat was also the day before I was due to have a pregnancy ultrasound. Sitting in my bedroom in the orange semi-light at midday I looked at the murky sight outside my window and wondered \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d At best, I was experiencing the type of prolonged and acute stress that means my baby was flooded with potentially life-altering cortisol hormones and had, despite my best efforts, no doubt been exposed to damaging levels of fine particulates. At the worst, had I created a person who would be born just to watch the world end? \u00a0\nPerhaps, I thought, I have made a terrible mistake.\u00a0\u00a0\nSitting 600km away in Melbourne as I write this, where the sky is blue and people come and go about their daily life, it\u2019s hard to convey the intensity of living in the middle of a long-running disaster. The world narrows. Your ability to think critically evaporates. \u00a0\nNew daily rituals emerge \u2013 wake up, check the fire warnings, check the air quality reading. Get out of bed, check the air purifier. Next, wash brown smoky water out of clothing or animals that have left the sanctuary of the house for any period of time.\u00a0\nThen go about your day, trapped inside, always with one eye on the live stream. Your social life reduces to rushing from your car inside a friend\u2019s house where you look at the live stream together while externalising your shared internal monolog of \u201cWe are not OK. The world is not OK.\u201d \u00a0\nThat next day, at the ultrasound, there was no heartbeat.\n",
