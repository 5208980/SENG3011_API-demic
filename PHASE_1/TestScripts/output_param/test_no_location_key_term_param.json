The Google translation:\nAccording to a Xinhua News Agency report from the Wuhan Public Security Bureau on the 1st, some false information about \"Wuhan Viral Pneumonia\" has been circulating on the Internet recently, and the public security department investigated it. Currently, eight people have been dealt with by the police in accordance with the law due to the distribution of false information.\u00a0\nAccording to the Wuhan police report, recently, some medical institutions in Wuhan have found and received multiple cases of pneumonia. Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a briefing on this. However, some netizens publish and forward false information on the Internet without verification, causing adverse social impact. After investigation and verification by the public security organs, eight illegal personnel have been summoned and handled according to law.\u00a0\nWuhan police reminded that laws and regulations should be followed when posting information and remarks on the Internet. The police will investigate and deal with illegal acts of fabricating, spreading, spreading rumors and disrupting social order, and will not tolerate them. The police urged netizens not to create rumors, believe rumors, or spread rumors, and to build a harmonious and clear cyberspace. \u00a0\nAccording to a report by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31, 2019, some medical institutions recently discovered and received multiple cases of pneumonia that were associated with the local South China Seafood Wholesale Market. The diagnosis of viral pneumonia was conducted by experts. As of the notification day, no human-to-human transmission was found in the investigation, and no medical staff infection was found.\n",

Excerpt:\nThousands of tourists holidaying on the south coast of Australia have been told to evacuate before another heatwave over the weekend expected to intensify deadly wildfires sweeping through the region.\u00a0\nIn an unprecedented appeal, the Rural Fire Service said anyone in the southeastern tip of New South Wales state should get out in the next two days with more extreme weather expected on the weekend.\u00a0\nThe 230km (143-mile) stretch from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria state border has been ravaged by fires this week, as infernos turned the sky blood red and rained down embers and ash on communities.\u00a0\n\u201cWe cannot overstate the potential risk of more damage and more destruction,\u201d RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Sky News Thursday. \u201cThere is a big effort between today and tomorrow to get as many people out of the south coast as we can.\u201d\u00a0\nSaturday is forecast to bring gusting winds and temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). That weather will create dangerous fire conditions that officials say will be as bad \u2013 if not worse \u2013 than Tuesday, Australia\u2019s deadliest day of fires in a months-long bushfire crisis.\u00a0\nNSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told public broadcaster ABC it would be the \u201clargest evacuation of people out of the region ever\u201d, with thousands preparing to leave ahead of another \u201cterrible\u201d day of fires.\nNSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said firefighters were unable to extinguish or even control the raging blazes.\u00a0\n\u201cThe message is we\u2019ve got so much fire in that area, we have no capacity to contain these fires,\u201d he told ABC.\n\u201cWe just need to make sure that people are not in front of them.\u201d\u00a0\nAt least seven people have been killed on the south coast of New South Wales earlier this week and hundreds of properties destroyed. Thousands of locals and tourists have been stranded in the rural, forested region at the peak of the summer holiday season.\u00a0\nFitzsimmons said the main highway to the north was now mostly open, and as power was restored, gas stations would be able to dispense fuel to motorists.\u00a0\nIsolated communities in Victoria remain cut-off by road, including the township of Mallacoota, where some 4,000 people were forced to shelter on the beach or escape by boat as wildfires swept through.\u00a0\nNavy ships and military aircraft have been deployed alongside emergency crews to provide humanitarian relief and assess the damage.\nMilitary helicopters and ships have been scrambled to bring in supplies and for potential evacuations if roads can\u2019t be reopened.\u00a0\nThe scale of the crisis, played out in real-time on social media as people posted footage and images of raging fire-fronts bearing down on communities, has shocked Australia and fuelled an emotive debate about the impact of global warming in the world\u2019s driest inhabited continent.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s government is coming under sustained criticism from environmentalists and the opposition after repeatedly downplaying any links to climate change, and for not taking stronger steps to curb emissions.\n",

Excerpt:\nSince the last disease outbreak news published on 19 December 2019, 29 new confirmed cases were reported from 18 to 31 December in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu province. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from eight health areas in four health zones: Mabalako (62%, n=18), Butembo (14%, n=4), Kalunguta (17%, n=5), and Katwa (7%, n=2). Three of the four cases reported in Butembo in the past fourteen days are linked to a transmission chain of more than 50 people that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone.\u00a0\nOne individual classified as a relapse case of EVD, infected several other individuals within the family and through nosocomial transmission (for more information, please see the disease outbreak news published on 19 December 2019).\u00a0\nIn Kalunguta Health Zone, the five cases reported between 24 and 28 December 2019, are a distinct epidemiologically linked chain of transmission, although the source of exposure is currently under investigation.\u00a0\nIn the past 21 days (11 December to 31 December), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health areas within five neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu province (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (68%, n=27), Butembo (13%, n=5), Kalunguta (13%, n=5), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Biena (3%, n=1). The majority of the cases (75%, n=30) are linked to known chains of transmission.\u00a0\nAs of 31 December, a total of 3380 EVD cases were reported, including 3262 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2232 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1900) were female, 28% (n=953) were children aged less than 18 years, and 168 (5% of all reported cases) were healthcare workers.\n",

Excerpt:\nSINGAPORE - Travellers arriving from Wuhan in China will undergo temperature screening at Changi Airport from Friday evening (Jan 3), in light of a pneumonia outbreak in the Chinese region. \u00a0\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday evening it has told doctors to look out for suspected cases of people who returned recently from the area. \u00a0\nAs a precaution, patients with fever and acute respiratory illness or pneumonia, who had travelled to Wuhan at least 14 days before the onset of their symptoms, will be isolated to prevent transmission, it added.\u00a0\nAFP had reported on Tuesday that China was investigating an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that is suspected of being linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), the flu-like virus that killed 774 worldwide - including 33 in Singapore - during a 2003 outbreak. \u00a0\nThe South China Morning Post newspaper said at least 27 infections had been reported as of Tuesday, most of whom were stallholders at a seafood market. It said that Hong Kong was on alert, with border screenings being set up. \u00a0\nAt the time, AFP also quoted Wuhan\u2019s health commission as saying that seven of the patients were in a critical condition, while the others were stable and two would be discharged soon. \u00a0\nAccording to the commission, initial lab tests found that there was no apparent human-to-human transmission and that no medical staff were infected. \u00a0\nAs of Thursday, Chinese authorities could not confirm whether the pneumonia outbreak was linked to Sars. But MOH said it was aware of the cluster of severe pneumonia cases in the region and was monitoring the situation closely.\u00a0\nSuspected cases spotted by\u00a0temperature screening at Changi Airport will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. \u00a0\nIn addition, health advisory posters for all travellers will be put up at the airport, and a health advisory will be issued to all inbound travellers on flights from Wuhan.\nAs of 8.30pm on Thursday, MOH had not been notified of any suspected cases.\n",

Excerpt:\nA few minutes before midnight on the last day of the year, Pacific daylight time, I began to cry.\nI\u2019m a purportedly \u201cgrown man\u201d and I\u2019m not easily moved to tears, but as is the way with emotions, there wasn\u2019t much I could do when the tears came but to wipe them away and trust that they would stop, which eventually they did. \u00a0\nI cried for my country, for my Lucky Country, the wide brown land, the Fatal Shore \u2014 for Australia. I cried because when I woke up under the Tuscan sun just before 9 a.m. after our New Year\u2019s revels (i.e. just before midnight on Canada\u2019s West Coast, where I live), I looked at my phone and was informed that Australia was on fire as never before.\u00a0\nI know, the fires have been going on for weeks now. I\u2019ve tracked them as best I can from half a world away because my eldest son relocated to Sydney a few months ago to, among other things, escape the foul air of Shanghai and the foul system that passes for government in China; I also have a sister and nephews and their young families in Adelaide, where I was born. They are all okay, in that they still have roofs over their heads and, well, they aren\u2019t dead.\u00a0\nBut what was different on New Year\u2019s Day were fresh accounts from the front of thousands of Australians being herded onto beaches on the south coast of New South Wales \u2014 iconic Australian beaches now serving as the ironic last and only refuges from the pent-up fury of fires that cannot be, will not be controlled.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The Lancet Infectious Diseases:\u00a0Preparedness for emerging epidemic threats: a Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission. Excerpt:\nAt any time, an emerging, lethal, and highly transmissible pathogen might pose a risk of being spread globally because of the interconnectedness of the global population. Emerging epidemic threats are occurring with increasing scale, duration, and effect, often disrupting travel and trade, and damaging both national and regional economies. Even geographically limited outbreaks such as the Ebola virus disease in Africa might have a global effect.\u00a0\nPreparing for epidemic threats is not a static or binary (prepared or unprepared) exercise, but a dynamic state reflecting the constantly changing world. Countries prepare in different ways based on their interpretation of disease risks and international agreements such as the International Health Regulations (IHR). The IHR were introduced in 1969 to prevent spread of specific serious diseases between countries and set out preparedness measures at international borders to stop disease spread. The 2005 revisions to the IHR reflect changes across multiple dimensions, requiring countries to develop preparedness capacities to detect and respond to outbreaks where and when they occur, supported by international partners to respond when outbreaks cannot be contained locally.\u00a0\nHowever, disruptive factors have emerged at a greater pace over the past decade, creating a new ecology that requires novel strategies for preparedness. These factors include dealing with the increasing human population density and connectivity, harnessing novel data streams and new technological advances to manage epidemics, mitigating false information on social networks, to creating informal technical networks that can work together when political forces fail to do so.\u00a0\nDo the recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and yellow fever reflect this changing context of disruptions requiring dynamic responses? These outbreaks show that countries are at various stages of preparedness, and many have underdeveloped preparedness plans and response capabilities with weak or non-existent strategies to mitigate disruptive factors. Many countries face severe difficulties in providing universal health coverage, for example, and might overlook timely investments for threats that demand greater health-care facility or workforce requirements.\u00a0\nOther challenges include shifts in within-country and between-country cooperation, the evolving need for transdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approaches and social participation, and effective leadership, coordination, and financing of local national and international partners.\u00a0\nAgainst this backdrop, the Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission on Preparedness for Emerging Epidemic Threats was formed in mid-2019 to examine the importance of this new ecology and its disruptive factors that have resulted in an underprepared world, whether current planning assumptions still hold, and what mitigation measures need to be introduced.\n",

The full statement and then a comment:\nThe Government today (January 4) launched the Preparedness and Response Plan for Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance (The Plan). In parallel, the Serious Response Level was activated with immediate effect. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Plan sets out the Government's preparedness and response plan in case of an outbreak of Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance. A three-tier response level is adopted in the plan. Three response levels, namely Alert, Serious and Emergency, will be activated based on the risk assessment of the Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance that may affect Hong Kong and its health impact on the community. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nUpon the risk assessment of the cluster of cases of viral pneumonia with unknown cause in Wuhan reported by the National Health Commission, the Serious Response Level was activated. Under the Serious Response Level, the immediate health impact caused by Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance on local population is moderate. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"'Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance' refers to any infectious disease caused by a pathogen unknown to cause human disease before, but may have changed its property to cause human infection with or without the ability of efficient human-to-human transmission. The disease has the potential to lead to international spread and public health emergency. The current cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan can be regarded as a Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance,\" a spokesman for the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health said. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The Government will assess the risk from time to time in view of the latest scientific evidence and situation, activate or deactivate the response level and implement corresponding measures,\" the spokesman said. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information, please refer to the Plan which has been uploaded to the CHP's website (www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/govt_preparedness_and_response_plan_for_novel_infectious_disease_of_public_health_significance_eng.pdf).\nHong Kong's CHP was established after the shock of the 1997 H5N1 outbreak, and ever since it's been an exemplar of a public health agency. If sniffles break out in a kindergarten, or someone comes home from Dubai a bit feverish, CHP will be on the scene and prepared to tell the world what's infected the kids and whether the traveller has MERS (so far, not a single person).\nH5N1 may have fizzled out, but the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection has not.\n",

High levels of air pollution are expected to continue.\u00a0\nThere is no safe level of air pollution. The higher the level of pollution, the more hazardous the risks to health. Bushfire smoke is particularly hazardous because of the high levels of tiny particles (PM2.5).\u00a0\nBabies, young children and those who are elderly or already experience chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease are at higher risk, as are the socially and economically marginalised who may not have access to air conditioning or air purifiers. \u00a0\nAir pollution is linked to diseases throughout life: including premature births, low birth weight babies, impaired lung development in children, asthma, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.\u00a0\nThe levels of air pollution in NSW in recent weeks, and in the immediate future, remain hazardous to people\u2019s health. \u00a0\nThis is a public health emergency \u00a0\nGovernments have a responsibility to protect the people they represent.\u00a0\nBoth the Federal and State Government of NSW must prioritise action to help reduce the risks to people\u2019s health arising from hazardous air pollution from the bushfires that continue to burn relentlessly across the state. \u00a0\nWe call on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to demonstrate the leadership this public health emergency demands, and to implement measures to help alleviate the health and climate crisis. \u00a0\nAuthorities are encouraging people in affected areas to avoid exercise and stay indoors with windows and doors closed and, if they have medication for respiratory conditions, to use their medications as directed. \u00a0\nIn accordance with advice from the NSW Department of Health, if you are particularly susceptible to bushfire smoke, consider staying with a friend or relative whose house has clean indoor air or leaving the area for a cleaner environment. \u00a0\nProtecting health requires climate action \u00a0\nClimate change is worsening many extreme weather events such as serious bushfire weather, which is having devastating impacts on human health.\u00a0\nThe air pollution events resulting from bushfires will become more and more frequent and are a result of climate change. Our governments must act quickly to rapidly and deeply reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which we know are driving climate change.\u00a0\nThis moment calls for political leadership \u00a0\nAll of our political leaders must acknowledge the health and environmental emergency of climate change, and step up and commit to urgent climate action by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with what the science demands. \u00a0\nIn addition to responding to this public health emergency, we call on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Premier Gladys Berejiklian to lead action on climate change to protect our health.\u00a0\nThis must include a multi-portfolio response involving Federal and State governments and the development of a National Strategy on Climate, Health and Well-being. This will ensure a nationally coordinated approach to tackling the worsening health impacts of climate change, and that health service planning includes climate change preparedness to respond to the increasing demand for health services from extreme weather events, such as bushfires and heatwaves.\n",

They went to the publi\u00e7 Conde de S. Janu\u00e1rio Hospital Centre where tests showed that they had seasonal flu or other kinds of respiratory illness, while their conditions are stable and there are no signs of pneumonia.\u00a0\nThe statement said that all passengers arriving from Wuhan at the local airport will undergo temperature screening and will also have to fill in a health declaration form. According to the Macau Post Daily, the bureau said that so far none of the air passengers or travellers who have been to Wuhan recently arriving in Macau via any of the city\u2019s border checkpoints have been found to have a fever.\n",

            "main_text": "\nThanks to Mary Marshall for sending the link to this ScienceBlog.com report:Ebola-fighting protein discovered in human cells.\nResearchers have discovered a human protein that helps fight the Ebola virus and could one day lead to an effective therapy against the deadly disease, according to a new study from Northwestern University, Georgia State University,\u00a0University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the Gladstone Institutes published today, Dec. 13, in the journal Cell.\u00a0\nThe newly discovered ability of the human protein RBBP6 to interfere with Ebola virus replication suggests new ways to fight the infection. As viruses develop and evolve proteins to bypass the body\u2019s immune defenses, human cells in turn develop defense mechanisms against those viruses \u2014 an evolutionary arms race that has been ongoing for millions of years. This particular defense mechanism has therapeutic potential, said co-lead author\u00a0Judd Hultquist,\u00a0assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious disease at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who conducted the research while he was at Gladstone Institutes. \u00a0\n\u201cOne of the scariest parts about the 2014 Ebola outbreak was that we had no treatments on hand; tens of thousands of people became sick and thousands of people died because we lacked a suitable treatment,\u201d Hultquist said. \u201cWhat we envision is a small molecule drug that mimics this human protein and could be used in response to an Ebola virus outbreak.\u201d \u00a0\nA small molecule drug is the ultimate goal because these are able to enter cells more easily and, therefore, be more effective.\nThe Ebola virus, like other viruses, invades host cells and uses them to replicate, usurping cellular processes to build viral proteins, which eventually become new copies of the virus. In the current study, Hultquist and his collaborators used mass spectrometry \u2013 a technique that identifies specific elements in a sample by mass \u2013to search for interactions between human proteins and Ebola virus proteins.\u00a0\nThey found strong evidence for an interaction between the Ebola virus protein VP30 and the human protein RBBP6.Further structural and computational analysis narrowed the interaction down to a small, 23-amino acid-long peptide chain. This small group of amino acids alone is sufficient to disrupt the Ebola virus life cycle, Hultquist said.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you take that peptide and put it into human cells, you can block Ebola virus infection,\u201d Hultquist said. \u201cConversely, when you remove the RBBP6 protein from human cells, Ebola virus replicates much faster.\u201d\n",

I'd forgotten about Lunar New Year, when scores of millions travel all over China. That would add a new dimension to the outbreak. Excerpt:\nChinese health authorities should be on high alert for a possible new strain of pneumonia and learn from 2002\u2019s deadly Sars epidemic, medical experts said after cases of a mystery outbreak almost doubled in three days.\u00a0\nThe authorities in Wuhan, central China, said 44 people had been admitted to hospital with the unidentified virus, up from the 27 reported on Tuesday. Eleven of them were in a serious condition, while a further 121 people who had been in close contact with the infected patients had been placed under medical observation. No deaths have been reported.\u00a0\nWuhan Municipal Health Commission said that the origin of the viral pneumonia outbreak remained unknown. It said investigations had so far ruled out common flu, avian flu, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases. Further laboratory tests and investigations were under way.\u00a0\nThe commission added that there was no proof of human-to-human transmission, nor had any medical staff contracted the illness.\nIt came as Hong Kong Hospital Authority said on Friday that two female patients admitted to hospital after recently visiting Wuhan had been confirmed as having influenza, not the unidentified virus. In response to the Wuhan outbreak, airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan had tightened fever surveillance of arriving passengers.\u00a0\nEmily Chan Ying-yang, a medical professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a visiting professor at Oxford University, said that the sudden rise in cases in Wuhan was \u201cnot alarming\u201d but raised concerns that the virus may be a new strain.\u00a0\nIt takes less than 24 hours to confirm common types of flu, but rare strains can take longer, Chan said.\n\u201cIf it were Sars [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], we are experienced in managing it,\u201d Chan said. \u201cBut if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention.\u00a0\n\u201cThe scariest thing with Sars is its fatality rate, and that young people died. We don\u2019t know whether the serious cases in Wuhan are young or old people \u2013 that deserves attention.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nShe said it was important to share information with the community once the virus and cause were identified, because large numbers of people would be travelling across China during the Lunar New Year in late January.\u00a0\nProfessor Jiang Rongmeng, of Ditan Hospital in Beijing, one of China\u2019s top centres for treating infectious diseases, said the rise in infections was probably a consequence of active detection and reporting of unexplained pneumonia cases.\u00a0\n\u201cNo apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far, otherwise there would have been a community outbreak with more infections,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nReports so far suggested that the pneumonia could be caused by a rare virus or a previously unknown one, Jiang said, adding that identification may take up to a week.\n",

Excerpt from a long report:\nThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 3) received notification from the National Health Commission (NHC) on the latest information of the cluster of pneumonia cases detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province. The public is again urged to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to information from the NHC, a number of viral pneumonia cases with unknown cause have been identified since last December through medical surveillance. Symptoms were mainly fever while a few had presented with shortness of breath. As at 8am today, 44 cases have been reported. Among them, 11 cases were in serious condition and the remaining were in stable condition. All patients are receiving treatment in isolation. While 121 close contacts are under medical surveillance, contact tracing of close contacts is still ongoing.\u00a0\nEpidemiological investigations revealed that some patients are business operators at a local seafood market in Wuhan. For the time being, no obvious human-to-human transmission has been observed and no healthcare workers have been infected. While the causative pathogen and cause of infection are still under investigation, influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses and other common respiratory diseases such as adenovirus have been ruled out as the cause. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nIn response to the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the CHP has enhanced surveillance since December 31 last year. Taking into consideration of the latest situation, the CHP has revised the criteria for surveillance today to widen the scope. Doctors are requested to report to the CHP if they encounter patients with fever and acute respiratory symptoms, or pneumonia symptoms; and who had visited Wuhan (regardless of whether they have visited wet markets or seafood markets there) within 14 days prior to the onset of the illness. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe CHP will continue to maintain close liaison with the NHC and closely monitor the latest development of cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The CHP will timely update the surveillance criteria and testing strategies in accordance with the latest situation. A dedicated webpage (www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html) has also been set up to provide relevant information and health advice. To address the public's concern, the CHP will announce the details of cases reported under enhanced surveillance (www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf) on the above webpage daily to enhance transparency.\nLinks to those CHP pages are now in the Key Sites list.\n",

Check these Twitter feeds from FluTrackers, Mike Coston, and Dr. Ian Mackay.\u00a0\nHaving come late to the party, I'll do what I can to find new sources and information, like this RTHK report:\u00a0Two more fall ill in HK after visiting Wuhan. Excerpt:\r\nTwo more people are being treated in isolation at a local hospital after coming down with fever and pneumonia symptoms consistent with a mystery illness that has sickened 44 in Wuhan.\u00a0\nA woman and a girl, 41 and 12, fell ill after visiting the central mainland city within the past two weeks.\u00a0\nThe Hospital Authority says tests are being conducted. \u00a0\n\"The patients concerned are in stable condition. A preliminary investigation shows that both patients had not been to a wet market in Wuhan before the onset of symptoms,\" said chief infection control officer, Dr Raymond Lai, of the Hospital Authority.\u00a0\nIn addition to the latest two, five people in total have been isolated in local public hospitals since December 31, with two having already been discharged.\u00a0\nExperts say the disease bears similarities to the Sars outbreak of 2003.\u00a0\nThe latest development comes as authorities in Wuhan reported that the number of people affected by the mystery illness has risen to 44 from the earlier figure of 27, with 11 of the patients in a serious condition. But they said there was no reported human-to-human transmission and no medical staff have been infected.\n\n",

Excerpt:\nThe monitoring of rail passengers arriving in Hong Kong from a mainland Chinese city affected by the outbreak of an unidentified form of pneumonia appeared lax on Saturday, despite health officials triggering a \u201cserious\u201d response level.\u00a0\nA lane dedicated for travellers from Wuhan at the high-speed rail terminus in West Kowloon was unused even as passengers got off a train that had stopped in the central China metropolis, the Post observed on Saturday night.\u00a0\nThree members of staff, from an unknown agency, were standing at the end of the special lane \u2013 marked \u201ctravellers from Wuhan, please go this way\u201d \u2013 but made no visible attempts to identify passengers who had embarked in the Hubei province city.\nAlso at the arrival area, passengers had to walk past one of two counters making body temperature checks.\u00a0\nA notice from the health department asked people travelling from Wuhan to report if they had fever or respiratory symptoms up to 14 days before the outbreak. However, the A4 sign could be easily missed by passengers rushing past.\u00a0\nA broadcast at the station warning of the infectious disease outbreak in Wuhan and advising visitors there to avoid visiting local wet markets and seafood markets was probably the most obvious action taken by the authorities to alert travellers of the situation.\nIt also suggested people wear face masks and consult doctors as soon as possible if they show signs of a fever or cough after returning to Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome Hong Kong health experts have called for more stringent screening at all ports, but health chief Sophia Chan Siu-chee explained that unlike the airport, no extra temperature sensing devices were added to the rail terminus because passengers on trains from Wuhan had not necessarily been to the city.\u00a0\nAcross the border, inside Shenzhen North station, people travelled as usual with no special arrangements in place.\u00a0\nIn a carriage where a Post reporter sat, only two of about 50 passengers wore masks on the high-speed Beijing to Hong Kong service via Wuhan on Saturday afternoon.\u00a0\nA 27-year-old Hong Kong resident, who declined to give her name, boarded that train from Shenzhen at around 6.30pm without wearing a mask.\u00a0\n\u201cI know the train stopped in Wuhan, but I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Wuhan. The city is very big, much larger than Hong Kong. My family live far from the seafood market. Now there are only 44 cases with no specific cause confirmed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think there is nothing to worry about as long as people keep good personal hygiene, especially children,\u201d she said.\n",

In total, there were 2,233 deaths (2,115 confirmed and 118 probable) and 1,114 people healed;\u00a0\n\u2022 523 suspected cases under investigation;\u00a0\n\u2022 1 new confirmed case in North Kivu at Butembo;\u00a0\n\u2022 1 new death from confirmed cases, of which:\u00a0\no No community death was recorded;\u00a0\no 1 death from confirmed cases in North Kivu in Katwa;\u00a0\n\u2022 No healed person has left the CTE;\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 No health worker is among the new confirmed cases. The cumulative number of confirmed / probable cases among health workers is 164 (approximately 5% of all confirmed / probable cases), including 41 deaths.\n\nThe data presented in this table are likely to change later, after in-depth investigations and after redistribution of cases and deaths in their respective health zones.\nNEWS\u00a0\u00a0\nThe General Coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic intervenes at the 28th ethics day in Kinshasa\u00a0\n\u00a0\u2022 The general coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic, Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke, intervened this Saturday, January 04, 2020 at the twenty-eighth ethics day of Kinshasa organized by the urban council of the Order of physicians (CUOM) under the theme \"Medical ethics and ethics, the foundation of practice the art of healing\u201d in the Agora Amphitheater of the Bel Campus University in Kinshasa;\u00a0\n\u2022 For Prof. Ahuka, there is a link between managing the epidemic and ethics in medical practice. The Ebola crisis, he said, concerns all health personnel, particularly doctors, recalling that doctors must intervene in this crisis while respecting the ethics as intended by this day;\u00a0\n\u2022 \"There are many aspects of deontology and ethics in medical practice and in the management of Ebola. Lack of hospital hygiene is one of the major factors in the spread of the disease. To this is added the lack of prevention and control of infection in Congolese hospitals. This is an important element of which doctors must be aware, \"said the general coordinator of the response during the 28th ethics day in Kinshasa;\u00a0\n\u2022 The intervention of the general coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic at these meetings focused on the communication on the current situation of the Ebola virus disease epidemic;\u00a0\n\u2022 This day ended with the presentation of a diploma of merit to a few doctors and pharmacists for their distinction and commitment to their profession. The diploma of Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Ntamfum was symbolically awarded to Prof. Ahuka.\u00a0\nVACCINATION\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 4,551 people were vaccinated, until December 2, 2020, with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV / MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the two health areas from Karisimbi to Goma;\u00a0\n\u2022 Since the start of vaccination on August 8, 2018 with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, 261,027 people have been vaccinated; \u2022 Approved on October 22, 2019 by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health at the University of Kinshasa and on October 23, 2019 by the National Ethics Committee, the second vaccine, called Ad26.ZEBOV / MVA-BN -Filo, is produced by Janssen Pharmaceuticals for Johnson & Johnson;\u00a0\n\u2022 This new vaccine complements the first, rVSV-ZEBOV, a vaccine used until then (since August 08, 2018) in this epidemic manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, after approval by the Ethics Committee on May 20, 2018. was recently pre-qualified for certification.\u00a0\nENTRY POINT SURVEILLANCE\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 Since the start of the epidemic, the cumulative number of travelers checked (temperature taken) at health checkpoints is 134.802.696 ;\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022 To date, a total of 109 entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) have been established in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri in order to protect the country's major cities and avoid the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.\n",

Excerpt:\nThe NSW energy minister Matt Kean has urged residents across the state to reduce electricity usage as the Berejiklian government scrambles to determine the extent of fire damage to the Snowy Hydro's transmission lines. \u00a0\nThe NSW grid's links to Victoria went down late on Saturday afternoon, with Mr Kean issuing a statement urging all residents to preserve power.\u00a0\n\"The extensive bushfire activity in the Snowy Mountains and other areas of the state have had an impact on our electricity supplies,\u201d Mr Kean said.\u00a0\nJust before 7pm, 14,000 people had lost power in Sydney's north and south-west, and Port Stephens. Greenacre, Campsie, Punchbowl, Hornsby, Chatswood and St Ives were affected, as well as Port Stephens on the Central Coast.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), TransGrid and the NSW and ACT Governments were working closely \"to keep power supplies on\" but weather conditions meant authorities could struggle \"to keep the overall system secure.\u201d\nA senior official within a government agency, who did not want to be identified, told the Herald the transmission from Snowy \"had been taken out\" but a spokesperson for Mr Kean could not confirm the reports. \u00a0\nMr Kean asked consumers to make sure power-hungry pool pumps were turned off, raise air conditioner thermostats to 24 or 25 degrees, refrain from using washing machines, dishwashers or dryers, and turn off appliances and lights not in use.\u00a0\nAEMO was also working with large load electricity customers to reduce their electricity consumption where possible.\u00a0\nIn a statement, AEMO acknowledged that the health and wellbeing of consumers remains the highest priority, so urged consumers to only conserve energy \"if it is safe to do so.\" \u00a0\n\"Should the situation worsen further and AEMO loses all reserves available and energy unavailability continues to risk impacting the security of the National Electricity Market, as a last resort, AEMO may be forced to instruct controlled load shedding in NSW,\" the statement said. \u00a0\nIf the Snowy's ability to transmit power was impacted beyond a temporary hitch, both NSW and Victoria could face regular outages, possibly for weeks.\n",

At least 163 people who had been in close contact with those infected were placed under medical observation. A seafood market in the Hubei province city was the site of the outbreak.\u00a0\nThe authorities in Wuhan had previously ruled out common flu, avian flu, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases. Further laboratory tests and investigations were under way.\u00a0\nThe commission added that a preliminary investigation found no evidence of human-to-human transmission, and none of the medical staff had been infected. Some of the patients are vendors at the same seafood market, which has already been shut down and sanitised, it said.\u00a0\nHong Kong\u2019s Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said public hospitals had admitted eight more patients, including a boy, nine, and a two-year-old girl, in the 24 hours to noon on Sunday with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms who had also been to Wuhan in the past 14 days. At least seven of them confirmed that they had not been to any wet market there.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe patients were all in stable condition. Apart from the two children, the other new cases reported involved four men and two women, aged between 22 and 55. The nine-year-old boy, who was seen by a private doctor, was the latest suspected case revealed.\n",

As of 3 January 2020, a total of 44 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology have been reported to WHO by the national authorities in China. Of the 44 cases reported, 11 are severely ill, while the remaining 33 patients are in stable condition. According to media reports, the concerned market in Wuhan was closed on 1 January 2020 for environmental sanitation and disinfection. \u00a0\nThe causal agent has not yet been identified or confirmed. On 1 January 2020, WHO requested further information from national authorities to assess the risk.\u00a0\nNational authorities report that all patients are isolated and receiving treatment in Wuhan medical institutions. The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever, with a few patients having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs.\u00a0\nAccording to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker infections have been reported. \u00a0\nPublic Health Response\u00a0\nNational authorities have reported the following response measures:\u00a0\n\u2022 One hundred and twenty-one close contacts have been identified and are under medical observation;\u00a0\n\u2022 The follow-up of close contacts is ongoing;\u00a0\n\u2022 Pathogen identification and the tracing of the cause are underway;\u00a0\n\u2022 Wuhan Municipal Health Commission carried out active case finding, and retrospective investigations have been completed;\u00a0\n\u2022 Environmental sanitation and further hygiene investigations are under way.\u00a0\nWHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China. \u00a0\nWHO risk assessment\u00a0\nThere is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology. The reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals. The symptoms reported among the patients are common to several respiratory diseases, and pneumonia is common in the winter season; however, the occurrence of 44 cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization clustered in space and time should be handled prudently. \u00a0\nWuhan city, with a population of 19 million, is the capital city of Hubei province, with a population of 58 million people. WHO has requested further information on the laboratory tests performed and the differential diagnoses considered.\n",

Excerpt:\nSupplies of a mask widely used during the 2003 Sars outbreak in Hong Kong are running low amid the mystery pneumonia scare in the city, with some retailers doubling prices of limited stocks.\u00a0\nAt least three online platforms and 15 of the 21 pharmacies contacted by the Post said they had no more N95 respirators, but a doctor assured the public there was no need for panic buying as there was no sign yet of the disease spreading from the mainland Chinese city of Wuhan.\nAs of Monday, 59 cases were reported in Wuhan, with 21 suspected infections in Hong Kong. Some of the local cases have been found to involve known viruses or the flu, with others still pending test results.\u00a0\nThere has been no confirmed case outside the mainland city or evidence to suggest human-to-human transmission, according to health authorities there.\nA check by the Post on Monday on three local online platforms selling N95 respirators and recommended by manufacturer 3M showed they were out of stock.\u00a0\n\u201cDue to the huge number of mask orders, the delivery time will be a bit delayed,\u201d mall.builderhood.com, a website selling hardware materials, stated on its page.\nChecks on other online retailers such as HKTVmall and Henry Chemical also showed that the respirators, with prices ranging from HK$8 to HK$12 each, were unavailable.\u00a0\nA salesperson from Henry Chemical said they had been receiving a lot of orders from medical institutions since last week. \u201cThe masks should arrive at the end of this week. You can get them next week at the soonest.\u201d\u00a0\nDisposable surgical masks on the three sites were also out of stock.\u00a0\nOn Monday afternoon, the Post also conducted phone inquiries with 21 drug stores citywide on stocks for N95 respirators. Fifteen said they had no more supply, with four of the remaining six stores doubling prices to more than HK$24 [US$3] a piece.\u00a0\nSome retailers told the Post they marked up prices because suppliers had raised costs as customers rushed to hoard the item.\u00a0\nThe N95 is a disposable mask that can guard against hazardous substances, and was widely used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 which killed 299 people in the city.\u00a0\nOne staff member at a pharmacy in Sheung Shui told the Post that a new product batch would arrive on Monday afternoon, but he complained that the supplier had raised the wholesale cost.\u00a0\n\u201cThe supplier\u2019s price is crazy. It\u2019s HK$480 [US$61.76] for a box, which means HK$24 per pack. I used to sell these at HK$10 to HK$14 each,\u201d he said on the phone.\n",

Excerpt:\nMedical practitioners in Hong Kong must notify the government of anyone suspected to have been infected with the mystery Wuhan pneumonia under a change expected to be in place this week which also gives the authorities the power to place patients under mandatory quarantine.\u00a0\nThe Food and Health Bureau\u2019s announcement late on Monday night came as medical experts called on the government to step up health checks at the city\u2019s border and make visitors from Wuhan, which has been hit by a pneumonia outbreak, fill out a declaration form.\u00a0\nThe bureau said amendments to the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance were \u201cin full swing\u201d to include \u201csevere respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent\u201d as a statutory notifiable infectious disease. It is expected to be gazetted within this week.\u00a0\nOnce gazetted, medical practitioners who suspect a patient has the disease must notify the government. It is understood that the government would then have the power to order the patient be placed under quarantine.\u00a0\nThis cannot done at present because the unidentified Wuhan pneumonia, which does not even have an official name yet, is not listed in the ordinance.\nThe bureau\u2019s move came as Hong Kong\u2019s public hospitals, in the 24 hours to noon on Monday, admitted six more patients who had been to the city in Hubei province in the past 14 days and presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms \u2014 though they have not been confirmed as cases of the disease. Aged two to 65, they were all in stable condition and had not visited wet markets in Wuhan. That brings the total number of cases in Hong Kong to 21, though seven patients have already been discharged.\u00a0\nA seafood market in Wuhan is believed to be the source of the outbreak.\nWhile there have been 59 cases in Wuhan, there are no confirmed cases outside the mainland city or any evidence to suggest human-to-human infection.\u00a0\nCivic Party lawmaker Dr Kwok Ka-ki, a urologist, said local health officers should board trains from Wuhan \u2013 a city of 11 million people about a four-hour journey from Hong Kong \u2013 at the West Kowloon high-speed rail terminal and check passengers\u2019 body temperatures before allowing them to enter the city.\u00a0\n\u201cOfficers should spend 20 to 30 minutes to board trains, check body temperatures and ask passengers to fill out health declaration forms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be voluntary \u2014 it won\u2019t work and is meaningless.\u201d\u00a0\nThe government has arranged thermal imaging systems at both the rail terminal and the airport to conduct mass checks of visitors\u2019 body temperature as they walk past. At the rail terminal, there is also a special voluntary lane where travellers from Wuhan can stop for checks using handheld infrared thermometers. But a recent Post check saw no one using the lane.\nKwok said that making it mandatory for Wuhan visitors to fill out a health declaration form with their contact details, which is not required currently, would allow the government to track them down better.\u00a0\nA problem with using thermal imaging systems, rather than individual temperature checks, was that someone with fever could be missed if health officers were distracted for even a moment, Kwok added.\n",

Seven people have already been discharged from hospital.\nSo far, test results show that none of the cases reported outside mainland China \u2013 including one recent case in Singapore \u2013 were related to the Wuhan virus.\u00a0\nWhile the laboratory results have dispelled fears of a return of the deadly Sars epidemic in 2003 that killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong, the unconfirmed source and unidentified strain of a possible new form of pneumonia has caused alarm among health experts.\nIt's surprising that the Wuhan authorities have had samples of the new virus since December 12, when the first case turned up, and still haven't been able to identify it.\n",

Evidently China isn't telling even Hong Kong very much. Excerpt, with my bolding in the last paragraph:\nHong Kong is taking tougher precautions against a mysterious, pneumonia-like virus in central China, laying the legal groundwork to put patients under quarantine if necessary and making it mandatory for doctors to notify the authorities of any suspected cases in the city.\u00a0\nNine more travellers who returned from Wuhan with symptoms of either fever and respiratory infection or pneumonia were placed in hospital isolation wards on Tuesday, taking the total to 30 \u2013 13 of whom have already been discharged after treatment \u2013 since December 31, 2019.\u00a0\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, said that travellers entering the city from Wuhan had been put through extra temperature screenings since Monday night. This came soon after the Food and Health Bureau said it expected to list the unidentified virus as a notifiable disease by the end of the week, empowering the authorities to enforce quarantine measures.\u00a0\nThe Department of Health then announced on Tuesday afternoon that it would gazette a bill to amend the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance on Wednesday, including \u201csevere respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent\u201d as a statutory notifiable infectious disease with immediate effect.\n\u201cRecently some patients have been leaving hospitals before completing medical check-ups,\u201d Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said. \u201cThe amendment of the law this time would be important for Hong Kong in preventing the spread of a new disease.\u201d\u00a0\nBut Dr Henry Yeung Chiu-fat, president of the Hong Kong Doctors Union, warned of difficulties in meeting the notification requirement stipulated in the amended ordinance.\u00a0\n\u201cThe definition is wide and vague. I don\u2019t think we have the right to detain a patient at our clinic for too long just because they may have been to Wuhan and come down with a slight cold,\u201d Yeung said. Hong Kong set to add mystery \u2018pneumonia\u2019 to list of notifiable diseases 7 Jan 2020 He was concerned it could lead to Hong Kong over-reporting cases, while mainland China could be under-reporting them.\n\u201cIf that happens, soon the number of suspected cases in Hong Kong will be higher than the mainland. I am very worried this could be a serious thing; the mainland should release information to us so we know what is going on,\u201d he said.\n",

            "main_text": "\nWHO AFRO has published\u00a0Deaths from Democratic Republic of the Congo measles outbreak top 6000.\nKinshasa, 7 January 2020 \u2013 With the death toll from the world\u2019s worst measles epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) surpassing 6000, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for more funding to stop the outbreak. \u00a0\nUnder the leadership of the DRC Ministry of Health, WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partner aid agencies vaccinated more than 18 million children under five across the country in 2019. However, in some areas, routine vaccination coverage remains low and 25% of the reported measles cases are in children over the age of five, who are the most vulnerable.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are doing our utmost to bring this epidemic under control. Yet to be truly successful we must ensure that no child faces the unnecessary risk of death from a disease that is easily preventable by a vaccine. We urge our donor partners to urgently step up their assistance,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\u00a0\nSince the start of 2019, around 310 000 suspected measles cases have been reported. The epidemic has been aggravated by low vaccination coverage among vulnerable communities, malnutrition, weak public health systems, outbreaks of other epidemic-prone diseases, difficult access by vulnerable populations to health care and insecurity that has hampered response in some areas. \u00a0\nLack of funding remains a huge impediment to successfully curbing the outbreak. So far, US$ 27.6 million have been mobilized. However, a further US$ 40 million are required for a six-month plan to extend the vaccination to children between six and 14 years and to reinforce elements of the outbreak response beyond vaccination, including improving treatment, health education, community engagement, health system strengthening, epidemiological surveillance and response coordination. \u00a0\n\u201cWe recognize the Government\u2019s engagement in the efforts to end the outbreak and we are grateful for the generosity of our donors. But we still need to do more,\u201d said Dr Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Prosper Djiguimd\u00e9, Officer in charge of WHO office in the DRC. \u201cThousands of Congolese families need our help to lift the burden of this prolonged epidemic from their backs. We cannot achieve this without adequate finances.\u201d\u00a0\nThe European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, M\u00e9decins du Monde, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, WHO and other partners have been supporting the Government to bring the long-running epidemic under control. In December 2019, WHO trained 60 health professionals from the Ministry of Health to conduct a range of services, including community engagement, health education and surveillance. These health professionals are being deployed this week as part of the response.\n",

Excerpt:\nMIAMI \u2014 The strongest tremor yet in a week of heavy seismic activity rocked Puerto Rico early on Tuesday morning, knocking out power to much of the island, seriously damaging homes and buildings and leaving at least one person dead.\u00a0\nThe governor of Puerto Rico, Wanda V\u00e1zquez, declared a state of emergency throughout Puerto Rico and activated the National Guard.\u00a0\n\u201cIn 102 years, Puerto Rico had not experienced anything like this,\u201d she said. \u00a0\nThe 6.4-magnitude quake, which struck five miles southwest of Tallaboa on Puerto Rico\u2019s southwestern coast, was recorded at 4:24 a.m. local time, according to the United States Geological Survey. It was the second consecutive day that an earthquake hit the island before dawn, terrifying residents scared about the cumulative effect on older buildings that may be unsafe.\u00a0\nThe governor warned that the seismic activity is expected to continue in the coming days, as most of the island struggles with the massive power outage. A power plant in the south suffered significant damage, she said. The outage also left nearly a third of the island without running water.\nThe governor warned people whose houses do not meet building codes to seek shelter. About 255 people were already staying in shelters on Tuesday. \u00a0\n\u201cThere is nothing to indicate from the experts who know these types of disasters that this is going to be bigger than what we have seen so far, but yes we will have repetitions and tremors that we will be feeling,\u201d Ms. V\u00e1zquez said. \u201cThis is going to be happening for the next few days.

Excerpt:\nIn the spring of 2014, as Ebola exploded across West Africa, a scientist named Gary Kobinger was following the news intently from Canada. \u00a0\nKobinger was the head of the special pathogens unit at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. He and the team he led had a well-deserved reputation for their work on Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers; Kobinger himself had led development of a promising Ebola therapy.\u00a0\nThe Winnipeg lab also had been working for years on an Ebola vaccine, one that looked tremendously effective in animal models. The lab had even produced human-grade vaccine in the hopes of testing it in people. But as of April 2014, that still hadn\u2019t happened. The vaccine had never been deployed in an outbreak. No major pharmaceutical company had expressed interest in developing it.\u00a0\nWith Ebola appearing to spread rapidly in a country that had no experience trying to control it \u2014 Guinea \u2014 Kobinger contacted the World Health Organization to offer the vaccine. \u00a0\nThe WHO declined the offer.\u00a0\n\u201cThey thought it was premature to advance it,\u201d recalled Kobinger, who said he was told that Guinea lacked the infrastructure to approve use of an experimental vaccine. \u201cThat was true,\u201d he added. \u00a0\nThe reality was that, for years, scientists who studied Ebola, which belongs to a family of viruses called filoviruses, had poured their hearts into work to develop vaccines and drugs to combat these deadly scourges. And for years, they had seen promising work smash up against unscaleable walls. There was no potential for drug makers to recoup development costs; and, with outbreaks only sporadic, there was little opportunity to subject experimental vaccines to rigorous tests. \u00a0\nBut faced with the prospect of Ebola victims lying abandoned in the streets of African cities \u2014\u00a0and the world\u2019s self-interested realization that the virus rampaging through West Africa wasn\u2019t likely to stay there \u2014 the balance would eventually tip.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia the South China Morning Post:\u00a0China confirms new coronavirus as it investigates mystery Wuhan illness.\nChinese scientists investigating a mystery illness that has infected dozens in the central city of Wuhan have said it is a new strain of coronavirus from the same family that caused the 2002-03 Sars epidemic.\u00a0\nLaboratory tests have found a new type of coronavirus and the whole genome sequence of the new virus has been obtained, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Thursday, citing a task force of experts.\u00a0\nFifteen patients had tested positive for the new coronavirus, the report stated. It said the virus had been isolated from one of the 15 patients and showed \u201ctypical coronavirus morphology\u201d under electron microscope observation.\u00a0\n\u201cThe pathogen of these unexplained cases of viral pneumonia was initially identified as a new type of coronavirus,\u201d the report quoted the expert group as saying.\nThere have been 59 reported cases of the mysterious virus in Wuhan since late December, some of them connected to a seafood market in which wild animals had been sold. The market has since been closed.\u00a0\nRetrospective study identified that the first case had been identified on December 12 and the latest on December 29. No deaths have been reported and eight patients, no longer showing pneumonia symptoms, had been discharged from hospital by Wednesday.\u00a0\nThe Wuhan health authority has said that no human-to-human transmission has so far been detected.\u00a0\u00a0\nCoronaviruses can infect mammals such as pigs, cattle, cats, dogs, camels, bats and mice, as well as humans. Of the six previously known human coronaviruses, four were common and caused only minor respiratory symptoms similar to those of a cold.\nThe other two were serious respiratory diseases: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus that killed more than 700 people worldwide after originating in China, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus that had caused 449 deaths by 2015.\u00a0\nThe CCTV report said that the laboratory had used genomic sequencing, nucleic acid detection, virus isolation and other methods to analyse samples from patients.\u00a0\nAlthough it is possible to find evidence of a pathogen in a short period of time, it could take years to produce a vaccine.\u00a0\nThe expert group said the initial identification needed to be followed up with further research, according to the television report. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert from the Chinese University in Hong Kong, said some important details were still to be established.\u00a0\n\u201cSome key information, including which animal is the source of the virus, the incubation period and the transmission route, are still missing,\u201d Hui said.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia the South China Morning Post:\u00a0Wuhan \u2018pneumonia\u2019: Hong Kong health chief under pressure to seek more information from mainland authorities amid silence on latest patient numbers. Excerpt:\nHong Kong\u2019s health minister on Wednesday came under pressure to seek more details on the mystery Wuhan pneumonia outbreak from the mainland Chinese government, as lawmakers expressed concerns that authorities there had not released updates on patient numbers since Sunday.\u00a0\nThe lawmakers tabled urgent questions on the outbreak as in the 24 hours to noon on Wednesday, Hong Kong\u2019s public hospitals admitted eight more people who had been to Wuhan in central China in the past two weeks and presented with symptoms of either fever and respiratory infection or pneumonia.\u00a0\nThis brings the total number of suspected cases in Hong Kong to 38, though 21 patients have been discharged.\u00a0\nSecretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee was grilled for 2\u00bd hours in the Legislative Council on the government\u2019s response to the pneumonia situation in Wuhan.\u00a0\nSome lawmakers said Chan must press the mainland authorities for the genetic map of the Wuhan virus so Hong Kong experts could help look into the disease in case of an outbreak locally. The Hong Kong government also needed to ask the mainland side whether other cities or provinces had also been infected, they said.\u00a0\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said on Sunday that 59 people had been infected with the unidentified strain, seven of whom were in a critical condition.\u00a0\n\u201cThat was from its last update on January 5. Today is already January 8,\u201d Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan said. \u201cDo you have ways to really find out how many cases there are on the mainland at present, in particular in Wuhan? Can you obtain the genetic map?\u201d\nThe commission said on Wednesday night that eight people with the virus had been discharged from hospital.\u00a0\nNo other mainland government agencies had offered any updates.\u00a0\nA source said the mainland health authorities were likely to announce results of the investigation on the virus in around a week.\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s office in China, which said on Sunday it was closely monitoring the disease in Wuhan, offered no updates when asked on Wednesday.\u00a0\nThe Hong Kong government on Wednesday made it mandatory for all medical practitioners to notify the authorities of anyone suspected to have contracted the unidentified strain.\u00a0\nThis was done by gazetting a bill to amend the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, to include with immediate effect \u201csevere respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent\u201d as a statutory notifiable infectious disease. The law empowers officials to put patients in mandatory quarantine.\u00a0\nThe government has also stepped up checks on visitors coming from Wuhan by train or plane.\u00a0\nOther lawmakers, including the Democratic Party\u2019s Helena Wong Pik-wan, were concerned whether there were also cases in other Chinese cities. They urged the minister to find out as there was no such information.\nCivic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki, a urologist, said he had talked to public hospital doctors who told him the government knew hardly anything about the Wuhan pneumonia. That made it difficult for doctors to provide the best treatment to those who developed symptoms after returning from Wuhan recently, Kwok added.\u00a0\nThe health secretary replied that the governments of Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland had in 2005 signed an agreement to notify each other if any major public health incidents were discovered. The government had been in close contact with the mainland authorities and the mechanism had been working well, she stressed.\u00a0\nShe believed the mainland would tell the Hong Kong government if such pneumonia cases were found outside Wuhan, adding she would continue to ask the authorities for more information about the disease.\nHealth services sector lawmaker Joseph Lee Kok-long challenged the government\u2019s earlier announcement that the number of isolation beds in public hospitals could be raised from the current 480 to 1,400 in 72 hours.\u00a0\nAccording to the latest figures, 15 out of 17 public hospitals had over-occupancy rates in medical wards as of midnight on Tuesday, ranging from 103 to 131 per cent, because of the higher number of diseases triggered by winter weather.\u00a0\nOn this, Chan insisted the increase could be done in 72 hours. But she admitted there was \u201csignificant room for improvement\u201d regarding the overcrowding in hospitals.\n",

He developed fever, cough and sore throat on 8 December 2019 and was admitted to hospital on 10 December, then transferred to ICU on 16 December. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (UpE and Orf1a genes) on 16 December by the Shiekh Khalifa Medical Center laboratory. He has underlying comorbidities including hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, heart disease, asthma and hypertension. He has a history of close contact with dromedary camels and sheep at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He has no history of recent travel and has not been involved in slaughtering animals. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in intensive care unit isolation. \u00a0\nSince 2012, UAE has reported 89 cases of MERS-CoV (including this case) and 12 associated deaths. From 2012 through 29 December 2019, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2494 with 858 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states. \u00a0\nPublic health response\u00a0\nUpon identification of the patient, an incident report, case investigation and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation is ongoing and includes screening of all close contacts, including occupational contacts in his farm, household contacts and healthcare workers at the hospital where he sought care. All identified contacts of the confirmed case will be monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the confirmed case. \u00a0\nA total of 88 contacts have been identified, including 70 health care contacts and 18 household contacts. All close contacts of the patient were tested negative for MERS-CoV. \u00a0\nThe veterinary authorities have been notified and investigations for MERS-CoV in animals are ongoing.\n",

While I try to find more details, here's a report from Asia Times:\u00a0Wuhan disease spread by bats, animals: expert.\nThe unknown pneumonia-like disease outbreak in Wuhan in Hubei province probably originated from bats and spread through wild animals to humans, said a Hong Kong-based microbiologist and specialist of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\u00a0\nIt was likely the Wuhan disease was a new kind of coronavirus similar to SARS, Yuen Kwok-Jung, the Chair\u00a0of Infectious Disease at the\u00a0Department of Microbiology\u00a0of the University of Hong Kong, said Wednesday.\u00a0\n\u00a0It would not be difficult for mainland authorities to identify the coronavirus as China had accumulated a lot of experience about virus testing since the SARS outbreak in 2003, Yuen said, adding that he would not speculate why the mainland had not released more information about the disease in the past two days.\u00a0\nThere were six kinds of coronaviruses that could infect humans, as well as 24 other kinds that could infect animals including bats, birds, rats and cows, Yuen said. \u00a0\nAs most Wuhan patients had connections with the Huanan Seafood Market, there was a high chance the unknown coronavirus was transmitted to wild animals from bats and became mutated before it spread to humans, he said.\nUsually a new disease would not be highly infectious between humans so only people who had very close contact with the patients could be infected, he said. If the Wuhan disease was similar to SARS, patients could be cured by doses of ribavirin, protease inhibitor and interferon, he said. \u00a0\nPeople could help stop the spread of the disease simply by not eating wild animals, while markets should stop selling them, Yuen said. If 10-20 more cases are identified in Wuhan within the coming week, a community outbreak could have happened, he added.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia The New York Times:\u00a0The Flu Season May Yet Turn Ugly, C.D.C. Warns - The New York Times.\nThe United States may be headed into a bad flu season, according to figures recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nAs of the last week of December, \u201cwidespread\u201d flu activity was reported by health departments in 46 states. More ominously, a second measure \u2014 the percentage of patients with flu symptoms visiting medical clinics \u2014 shot up almost to the peak reached at the height of the 2017-18 flu season, which was the most severe in a decade. \u00a0\nAbout 61,000 Americans died of flu that season, the C.D.C. said. (The original estimate of 79,000 was revised downward last year; the agency said the number changed as more death certificate information became available.) \u00a0\nThis year\u2019s flu vaccine may not be particularly effective against the strain of the virus now widespread in the United States, experts said. But even so, it\u2019s worth getting the shot: people who are vaccinated fare better if struck by the flu than those who are not.\nIt is still too early to know how severe this season will be, said Lynnette Brammer, leader of the agency\u2019s domestic influenza surveillance team.\u00a0\nAlthough many people are coming down with flu, the two chief indicators of severity \u2014 hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 are not yet elevated, she noted. \u00a0\nDeaths from pneumonia and flu are actually lower than normal at this time. But reports of hospitalization and death normally lag other indicators by at least two weeks.\u00a0\nThe current season did begin unusually early. By late November, the flu had hit hard in the Deep South, from Texas to Georgia. The virus then broke out in California and the Rocky Mountain states, but was not widespread in the Northeast until recently.\u00a0\nThat pattern echoes what happened in Australia, where winter runs from June through August. Flu came unusually early to the Southern Hemisphere in 2019. In seasons when Australia has a bad flu season, the Northern Hemisphere sometimes does, too.\nIn another important way, however, the United States is not following Australia\u2019s lead. The A(H3N2) strain of influenza was dominant there last year, while most American cases this season have been caused by a very different strain, called B Victoria. (B strains are named for the cities where they were first isolated.) \u00a0\nB strain flus do not normally arrive until late in the season. But when they do, \u201cthey often impact children more than adults and older adults,\u201d Ms. Brammer said. \u00a0\nThe C.D.C. tracks the deaths of children individually, rather than making estimates, as is done for adults. Those over 65 are usually the group hardest hit by flu. Thus far this season, 27 children have died of flu \u2014 in 2017-18, 187 died \u2014 but pediatric deaths don\u2019t normally start peaking until mid-January.\n",

            "main_text": "\nThanks to Dr. Alexandra Phelan to tweeting the link to this deeply disturbing report in The Guardian:\u00a0Being pregnant in a climate emergency was an existential challenge. Miscarriage has brought a new grief. Excerpt:\nOn Boxing Day I had an article published about being pregnant in a climate emergency. It was about the conflicting and contradictory emotions many of us are forced to hold if we choose to take the leap of faith of bringing a child into the world in the midst of climate collapse. \u00a0\nAt the time I wrote that piece, the smoke came and went. Occasionally we caught snippets of blue sky. \u00a0\nWe could still hear birds then. See bees feeding on the summer flowers in our garden. \u00a0\nJust six days later, the house surrounded by a dense glowing orange fog of smoke, my writing felt both prescient and dated. The birds were gone. Canberra, and the wildlife that lives in the national parks that encircle it, was suffocating. Climate collapse wasn\u2019t a slow-moving force my child and I might gradually see impact our lives. It was here, now. Upon us and immediate. \u00a0\nThat was the day the smoke was the thickest. So thick it shut down the whole city, the airport closed, all roads in and out cut off with fire. It was the first day that felt like sunset from start to finish. A colour we\u2019ve come to think of as \u201capocalypse orange\u201d.\u00a0\nWhen, even though no fire had crossed the borders of the Australian Capital Territory, Canberrans had their cars packed to evacuate. Where everyone clutched their iPhones flicking between the live fire reporting and the live air quality reporting. Back, and forth, back and forth \u2026 on and on, we livestreamed the end of the world.\nThat was also the day before I was due to have a pregnancy ultrasound. Sitting in my bedroom in the orange semi-light at midday I looked at the murky sight outside my window and wondered \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d At best, I was experiencing the type of prolonged and acute stress that means my baby was flooded with potentially life-altering cortisol hormones and had, despite my best efforts, no doubt been exposed to damaging levels of fine particulates. At the worst, had I created a person who would be born just to watch the world end? \u00a0\nPerhaps, I thought, I have made a terrible mistake.\u00a0\u00a0\nSitting 600km away in Melbourne as I write this, where the sky is blue and people come and go about their daily life, it\u2019s hard to convey the intensity of living in the middle of a long-running disaster. The world narrows. Your ability to think critically evaporates. \u00a0\nNew daily rituals emerge \u2013 wake up, check the fire warnings, check the air quality reading. Get out of bed, check the air purifier. Next, wash brown smoky water out of clothing or animals that have left the sanctuary of the house for any period of time.\u00a0\nThen go about your day, trapped inside, always with one eye on the live stream. Your social life reduces to rushing from your car inside a friend\u2019s house where you look at the live stream together while externalising your shared internal monolog of \u201cWe are not OK. The world is not OK.\u201d \u00a0\nThat next day, at the ultrasound, there was no heartbeat.\n",

The executive summary:\nBetween 31 December 2019 and 5 January 2020, 59 pneumonia cases possibly associated with a novel coronavirus have been reported in Wuhan, China with a common exposure link to Wuhan\u2019s South China Seafood City market.\u00a0\nThe cases showed symptoms such as fever, dyspnoea, and radiological tests compatible with bilateral lung infiltrative lesions. Seven severe cases have been reported, but no deaths. No cases have been reported outside of Wuhan. According to Chinese authorities, no human to human transmission could be documented.\u00a0\nEpidemiological investigations including contact tracing activities are ongoing and hygiene- and environmental sanitation activities in the affected market have been carried out in Wuhan.\u00a0\nThree EU airports have direct flight connections to Wuhan and there are indirect flight connections to other EU hubs. Considering there is no indication of human-to-human transmission and no cases detected outside of China, the likelihood of introduction to the EU is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded. However, more epidemiological and laboratory information is needed in order to elaborate a comprehensive assessment of this event and the possible risk for the international spread.\u00a0\nECDC is monitoring this event through epidemic intelligence activities.

Excerpt:\nJust two weeks before tens of millions of Chinese travellers hit the road for Lunar New Year, health officials across Asia are scrambling to prevent the spread of a viral pneumonia outbreak in central China.\u00a0\nOfficials from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur are stockpiling protective gear, preparing isolation beds and even boarding trains to individually screen passengers to contain the virus, which Chinese scientists have identified as a new strain of coronavirus from the same family that caused the 2003 Sars epidemic.\u00a0\nThe disease, which originated in the provincial capital city of Wuhan, has sickened at least 59 people in China and prompted authorities to revise quarantine rules in Hong Kong, where at least 38 people have received hospital treatment in connection with the virus.\u00a0\nThe outbreak of a virus in the same family has raised the spectre of the Sars epidemic of 2003 that killed nearly 800 people and sickened thousands. At the time, Chinese officials cut the traditionally week-long May Day national holiday to just one day to discourage people from travelling, but were also criticised for playing down the severity of the outbreak.\nThis time around there are similar suspicions, with public health experts telling the South China Morning Post the true number of victims of the coronavirus outbreak could be higher than officially stated.\u00a0\nThe outbreak of the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year \u2013 often labelled the \u2018world\u2019s largest migration\u2019 \u2013 has prompted transport authorities in Asia, home to four of the world\u2019s top 10 busiest air transit hubs, to step up temperature screenings and checks on passengers as they prepare for a surge in Chinese tourists at the end of the month.\u00a0\nBut even with these checks, infectious disease experts warn they have little information to go on.\n\u201cAt this stage, the details that the international medical community have to work with are very limited,\u201d said Masayuki Saijo, head of the virology division of Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases. \u201cWe do not have any clinical information on patients.\u201d\u00a0\nHe added that pressure to monitor arrivals from China and elsewhere in Asia would increase should the illness continue to spread.\u00a0\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES\u00a0\nIn Hong Kong, officials have set up a protocol to board all trains entering from Wuhan and temperature screen inbound passengers.\u00a0\nHealth authorities across East and Southeast Asia have called for anyone who has recently visited China to report to a doctor immediately if they show symptoms, which include fever and difficulty breathing.\n",

Chinese investigators conducted gene sequencing of the virus, using an isolate from one positive patient sample. Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China\u2019s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\u00a0\nInitial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan provided by Chinese authorities last week \u2013 including the occupation, location and symptom profile of the people affected \u2013 pointed to a coronavirus (CoV) as a possible pathogen causing this cluster. Chinese authorities subsequently reported that laboratory tests ruled out SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens. \u00a0\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less-severe disease, such as the common cold, and others more severe disease such as MERS and SARS. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others do not. According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people. \u00a0\nGlobally, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas, including SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.\u00a0\nChina has strong public health capacities and resources to respond and manage respiratory disease outbreaks. In addition to treating the patients in care and isolating new cases as they may be identified, public health officials remain focused on continued contact tracing, conducting environmental assessments at the seafood market, and investigations to identify the pathogen causing the outbreak.\u00a0\nIn the coming weeks, more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture. Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely and, together with its partners, is ready to provide technical support to China to investigate and respond to this outbreak. \u00a0\nThe preliminary determination of a novel virus will assist authorities in other countries to conduct disease detection and response. Over the past week, people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports.\u00a0\nWHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available.\n",

            "main_text": "\nVia the Centre for Health Protection:\u00a0CHP provides update on latest progress on cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.\nThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (January 9) received notification from the National Health Commission (NHC) on the latest progress of the identification of the pathogen for the reported cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to information from the NHC, the Mainland's expert group has preliminarily determined that the pathogen of the cluster of viral pneumonia cases occurring in Wuhan is a kind of novel coronavirus. The relevant Mainland laboratory has detected a novel coronavirus and obtained the whole genome sequence of the virus. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe expert group revealed that molecular testing of 15 cases returned positive results\u00a0for the novel coronavirus, and the virus was also isolated from a sample of a case. Under electron microscopy, the virus showed the typical appearance of coronavirus. The expert group added that the testing for nucleic acid, genome and antibodies from the samples of patients could be completed within a short period, thereby assisting in confirmation of the pathogen. Nonetheless, the virus isolation and pathogenicity studies would take several weeks. Moving forward, further deliberation by experts taking into consideration pathogen research, epidemiological investigation and clinical assessment is needed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nA spokesman for the CHP said that the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch is conducting molecular testing for a number of coronaviruses. The CHP has already contacted the NHC regarding the novel coronavirus in today's notification, and expressed the wish to obtain relevant information of the virus, including its genetic sequence, so as to provide accurate testing for the novel coronavirus. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nOn the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) earlier pointed out that there is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia. The WHO emphasised that more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture. Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe Scientific Committee on Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Infection Control under the CHP today convened a joint meeting, during which members were updated on the latest progress relating to the Wuhan cases. At the meeting, members discussed and provided advice on the corresponding local response to this novel communicable disease in various aspects of disease prevention and control, including surveillance, emergency preparedness, port health measures, risk communication and health promotion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe Scientific Committees noted that definite evidence of human-to-human transmission had not been identified in the Mainland so far and no healthcare professionals had been found infected. However, members considered that the available epidemiological information is not sufficient at this stage to reach a conclusion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe Scientific Committees concurred with the assessment of the WHO that the reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market in Wuhan could indicate an exposure link to animals. Members also arrived at consensus that public education should be strengthened in urging the public not to consume game meat and not to patronise food premises where game meat is served. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nNotwithstanding the risk of importation to Hong Kong of serious pneumonia cases related to those in Wuhan due to extensive travel, especially with the approach of the Lunar New Year holidays, the Scientific Committees acknowledged the well-developed public health system and hospital infrastructure on infection control as well as heightened awareness of the public and healthcare professionals. In the event that cases were imported to Hong Kong, the risk of spread in the local community could be reduced.\u00a0\nAs the Mainland and Hong Kong have now entered the winter flu season, members also advised the public to receive seasonal influenza vaccination before travelling and to always maintain good personal and environmental hygiene when travelling abroad.\n",

The summary:\nBackground\u00a0\nHong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent social unrest since June, 2019. We examined the associated population mental health burden, risk factors, and health-care needs.\u00a0\nMethods\u00a0\nIn a population-based prospective cohort, adult participants aged 18 years or older were assessed at nine timepoints from 2009. Probable depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (score \u226510) and suspected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by the PTSD Checklist\u2014Civilian Version (score \u226514), plus direct exposure to traumatic events related to the ongoing social unrest. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with both outcomes, adjusting for doctor-diagnosed depression or anxiety disorders before the unrest. On the basis of routine service statistics and respondents' intention to seek professional care, we projected the number of additional ambulatory specialist psychiatric visits required.\u00a0\nFindings\u00a0\nAfter the two baseline surveys, we followed up random subsets of 1213\u20131736 adults at each timepoint. Probable depression was reported by 11\u00b72% (95% CI 9\u00b78\u201312\u00b77) of participants in 2019, compared with 1\u00b79% (1\u00b76\u20132\u00b71) during 2009\u201314 and 6\u00b75% (5\u00b73\u20137\u00b76) in 2017 after the Occupy Central Movement and before the current unrest. Prevalence of suspected PTSD in 2019 was estimated to be 12\u00b78% (11\u00b72\u201314\u00b74). Age, sex, educational attainment, or household income were not associated with either outcome, whereas heavy social media use (\u22652 h per day) was associated with both. Political attitude or protest participation was not associated with probable depression, but neutrality towards the extradition bill approximately halved the risk of suspected PTSD. Family support mitigated against probable depression. We estimated that the mental health burden identified would translate into roughly an excess 12% service requirement to the public sector queue or equivalent.\u00a0\nInterpretation\u00a0\nWe have identified a major mental health burden during the social unrest in Hong Kong, which will require substantial increases in service surge capacity. Health-care and social care professionals should be vigilant in recognising possible mental health sequelae. In a world of increasing unrest, our findings might have implications for service planning to better protect population mental health globally.\nSee also this comment in The Lancet on the Hong Kong study.\n",

Excerpt:\nTwelve new confirmed cases were reported from 1 to 7 January in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from nine health areas in four health zones: Butembo (42%, n=5), Mambasa (33%, n=4), Mangina (17%, n=2), and Beni (8%, n=1). The new case reported in Beni is linked to a transmission chain that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone.\u00a0\nIn the past 21 days (18 December 2019 to 7 January 2020), 41 confirmed cases were reported from 13 health areas within six active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (49%, n=20), Butembo (22%, n=9), Kalunguta (12%, n=5), Mambasa (10%, n=4), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Beni (2%, n=1). Mabalako Health Zone remains the main hotspot of the outbreak having reported 49% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days.\u00a0\nAlthough the majority of the cases (76%, n=31) are linked to known chains of transmission, there are concerns around the reintroduction of the disease into health zones with dense populations which have previously been cleared, such as Butembo, Katwa, and Beni Health Zones. The sources of exposure for five new cases reported in Kalunguta Health Zone and four new cases reported in Mambasa Health Zone in the past 21 days are currently under investigation.\u00a0\nAs of 7 January, a total of 3392 EVD cases were reported, including 3274 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2235 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1903) were female, 28% (n=956) were children aged less than 18 years, and 169 (5% of all reported cases) were healthcare workers.\nMeanwhile, the MoH/WHO AFRO dashboard reports 1 new case on January\u00a0 9, making the total 3,393 since the outbreak began.\n",
